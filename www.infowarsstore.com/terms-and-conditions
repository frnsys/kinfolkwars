</ol>
<p class="item-description">Welcome to the terms and conditions ("Terms") for InfowarsStore.com&rsquo;s Auto Ship subscription service. These Terms are between you and Infowars Store and govern our respective rights and obligations for subscription ordering. The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and InfowarsStore.com related to subscription ordering. If you place an order through our subscription ordering program, you accept these Terms. Please read these Terms carefully.</p>
<p class="item-description"><strong>Program Benefits</strong></p>
<p class="item-description">After you select the frequency with which you want to receive your supplements, we will automatically send out your orders for delivery on the schedule you selected. Auto-Ship orders can be scheduled for weekly deliveries, at a frequency of every 14 Days, 30 Days and 42 Days. There are additional options for 60 and 90 Day to Auto Ship, but do vary based on availability and product itself. Your enrollment in Auto-Ship starts with your first automatic delivery order.</p>
<p>All participants will receive an email notification 2 days prior to their fulfillment order being placed. Orders may be canceled and or changed up until the order is placed. You will only be charged for orders that have been sent out for delivery. You may also change the replenishment frequency, item quantity and method of payment associated with your subscription at any time online by accessing &ldquo;My Subscriptions&rdquo; in the "My Account" Option or calling 1-888-253-3139.</p>
<p class="item-description"><strong>Payments</strong></p>
<p class="item-description">The total cost charged to your method of payment for each order will be the price of the item(s) on the day the order is processed plus sales tax and delivery fees. &nbsp;Please note that your original purchase price does not secure a locked-in rate. &nbsp;The reoccurring subscription payment may be different than the promotional price you opted in with. &nbsp;For example, if you purchased an item that is on sale for $19.95 and you opted into our Auto Ship program. &nbsp;You would be charged $17.96 ($19.95 - 10%) plus any applicable taxes. &nbsp; If on the first day of your renewal the item is no longer on sale for $19.95 and has returned to its regular price of $24.95. &nbsp;You will be charged for payment of the item that reflects the current price that day, ($24.95 + any applicable shipping ).&nbsp;Delivery fees will be based on standard shipping rates to your ship to location.</p>
<p>Unless you update your method of payment, the charge for each order will be billed to the method of payment used when you placed your first Auto-Delivery order. If the method of payment becomes invalid at any time during the subscription period or if the charge is otherwise rejected, we will send an email to the email address associated with your subscription notifying you that the subscription has been placed on hold. Your subscription will remain on hold and no additional orders will be processed or shipped until the information is updated.</p>
<p>Your subscription will remain in effect until your subscription is cancelled. Any related item discounts and/or incentives will remain in effect until the subscription is cancelled or until the expiration date of the offer, whichever is earlier. Other promotion pricing and limited-time offers may not be combined with the Auto-Ship order discounts and/or incentives (e.g. Coupons and/or Other Promotional Offers Included Saving 10% on your first Auto Ship Order).</p>
<p class="item-description"><strong>Agreement Changes</strong></p>
<p class="item-description">We may, in our sole discretion, change these Terms and/or our Privacy Policy at any time. Any such changes to the Auto-Ship program will be communicated via email. Changes to our Privacy Policy may be made on the site without notice. By using Auto-Ship, you agree to be bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically visit this page to determine the current Terms to which you are bound. We may terminate your Auto-Ship plan at our discretion without notice. If we do so, you will only be charged for orders that have been sent out for delivery to you.</p>
