In their follow-up to Dead Wrong, authors Richard Belzer and David Wayne are back again to set the record straight; this time they're going to uncover the truth about the many witness deaths tied to the JFK assassination. The simple observation that it is statistically impossible for so many witness deaths to simply be coincidence has dramatic implications.\u00a0 The math indicates that witnesses who \"knew something\" were systematically eliminated. For decades, government pundits have dismissed these \"coincidental\" deaths, even regarding them as \"myths\" or \"urban legends.\"\u00a0 However, this book reveals startling different conclusions.\u00a0 Like most people, Richard and David were initially unsure about what to make of these \"coincidences.\" After all, events don't consult the odds prior to happening; they simply happen. Then someone comes along later and figures out what the odds of it happening were. Some of the deaths seemed purely coincidental; heart attacks, hunting accidents. Others clearly seemed noteworthy; witnesses who did seem to know something and did seem to die mysteriously.Hit List reveals facts and theories about the suspicious deaths of:\n\nJimmy Hoffa\nMary Pinchot Meyer\nJ.

Gumpert that exposes who really decides what we eat.  This book examines the following life or death question:  Do Americans have the right to privately obtain the foods of our choice from farmers, neighbors, and local producers, in the same way our grandparents and great grandparents used to do?  A growing number of people answer yes. These educated and engaged individuals are increasingly afraid that the mass-produced food sold at supermarkets is excessively processed, tainted with antibiotic residues and hormones, and lacking in important nutrients. These people, a million or more, are seeking foods outside the regulatory system, like raw milk, custom-slaughtered beef, and pastured eggs from chickens raised without soy, purchased directly from private membership-only food clubs that contract with Amish and other farmers.  Public-health and agriculture regulators say no: Americans have no inherent right to eat what they want. In today's ever-more-dangerous food-safety environment, they argue, all food, no matter the source, must be closely regulated, and even barred, if it fails to meet certain standards. These regulators, headed up by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with help from state agriculture departments, police, and district-attorney detectives, are mounting intense and sophisticated investigative campaigns against farms and food clubs supplying privately exchanged food-even handcuffing and hauling off to jail, under threat of lengthy prison terms, those deemed in violation of food laws.  Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Food Rights takes readers on a disturbing cross-country journey from Maine to California through a netherworld of Amish farmers paying big fees to questionable advisers to avoid the quagmire of America's legal system, secret food police lurking in vans at farmers markets, cultish activists preaching the benefits of pathogens, U.S. Justice Department lawyers clashing with local sheriffs, small Maine towns passing ordinances to ban regulation, and suburban moms worried enough about the dangers of supermarket food that they'll risk fines and jail to feed their children unprocessed, and unregulated, foods of their choosing.  Out of the intensity of this unprecedented crackdown, and the creative and spirited opposition that is rising to meet it, a new rallying cry for food rights is emerging.

One of the key revelations Quigley reveals is a secret organization created by Englishman Cecil Rhodes.\u00a0 Rhodes was the founder of diamond company De Beers, ardent supporter of British colonialism and creator of the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship that has since educated so many global elite leaders. Funded by Rhodes' estate, the goal of this organization was to consolidate world control into the hands of the English speaking elites.\u00a0 This book ties together how this secret organization of global elites has quietly steered the world towards a goal of global government using collectivism. As an insider with access to many secret documents, Quigley was proud of the achievements of this secret organization and wrote this book from that viewpoint.\u00a0 The book was intended to only be read by fellow academics and other insider intellectuals that shared a similar world view.\u00a0 The book was quickly taken out of print when it became more widely circulated and opponents latched onto it as a confession of the global elite.\u00a0 As pressure mounted, the publishers relented and authorized this identical reissue edition. This book continues to provide one of the most revealing looks into the goals and methodology of the global elite.\u00a0 This book is printed in limited quantities and not readily available at most mainstream bookstores.\u00a0 Infowars is proud to have secured a batch of Tragedy & Hope and to help spread this valuable history and information.Quotes from Tragedy & Hope:\"The powers of financial capitalism had [a] far-reaching aim, nothing  less than to create a world system of financial control in private  hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the  economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a  feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert by  secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and  conferences.\"     -- Carroll Quigley, Chapter 20.\"There  does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international  Anglophile network. I   know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for   twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960's, to   examine its papers and secret records. I have no  aversion to it or  to most of its aims and have, for much of my life,  been close to it and  to many of its instruments. I have objected, both  in the past and  recently, to a few of its policies ... but in general  my chief difference of opinion is that it  wishes to remain unknown, and  I believe its role in history is  significant enough to be known.\"\u00a0 --Carroll Quigley, Chapter 65."}, {"itemid": "BK-TRLEG-SQ-1", "subcat": "Books", "name": "True Legends - Book", "img": ["true-legends-thumbnail.jpg", "true-legends-back-thumbnail_1.jpg"], "price": "$39.95", "desc": " In 1984, George Orwell wrote of a totalitarian society in which the government constantly revised history in order to make it conform to the claims of the ruling elite. Ironically, our own society has evolved into a similar system of rewriting history. However unlike that society described by Orwell, those rewriting our history have engaged in a much more effective and insidious process, with only a few hints from time to time to suggest anything might be amiss.\nMost citizens in the West spend their whole lifetimes blissfully unaware that they have been fed a carefully edited view of the past, tailored to prop up the powers that be and keep humanity ignorant of their own past and the dangers that the past presents in the here and now. Where Orwell's Big Brother was overtly aggressive in his rule, today's ruling elite are every secretive and hide behind various media outlets, scientific organizations, government offices, and secret societies.\nTheir control is not infinite or complete, but it comes close with only those willing to self publish or post on the Internet generally being able to circumvent their control. Later in this book I will be outlining who these secret rulers are (and have presented a fuller picture of their secrets and goals in my previous books Genesis 6 Giants - Master Builders of Prehistoric and Ancient Civilizations, and Angel Wars: Past, Present, Future).1 In these books I've documented both how there is definitive proof of the existence of giants and other terrifying creatures both in the form of artifacts as well as historical accounts (echoed in mythology) and will also note how the physical proof is regularly spirited away and destroyed or quietly deposited in obscure museums and dark back rooms where the public is never allowed."}, {"itemid": "BK-UNSPEAK-CH-1", "subcat": "Books", "name": "Unspeakable", "img": ["unspeakable.jpg"], "price": "$34.95", "desc": " UNSPEAKABLE\u00a0\nChris Hedges has been telling truth to (and against) power since his earliest days as a radical journalist. He is an intellectual bomb thrower, who continues to confront American empire in the most incisive, challenging ways. The kinds of insights he provides into the deeply troubled state of our democracy cannot be found anywhere else. Like many of our most important thinkers, he has been relegated to the margins because of ideas deemed too radical\u2014or true\u2014for public consumption. Whether it is covering the dissolution of former Soviet states or embedding in the Middle East to understand the post-9/11 world, he has been a singular voice pushing against mainstream media disinformation and the amnesia of establishment received wisdom. He is an intellectual heir to American radical heroes such as Thomas Paine and Noam Chomsky, and is dedicated to reigniting a shared commitment to radical equality and honesty.Hedges here speaks up about the most pressing issues that currently face our nation. He tackles the rise of a fascist right in support of Donald Trump, which advocates xenophobia and violence in a push for American totalitarianism. He rails against the posturing of inclusivity from establishment elites on both sides of the aisle, who post-Occupy-Wall-Street continue to advocate for policies that make America uninhabitable for all but the ultra-rich and, as lackeys for corporate interests, continue to expand income inequality in all directions. He tears into the contemporary glamorization of the military and the unchecked, unchallenged hawkishness that defines contemporary American foreign policy. Moreover, he shows his support for contemporary revolts against this twisted order\u2014such as Black Lives Matter\u2014that represent Americans refusing to take the destruction of their country lying down. And that\u2019s just the start.He possesses a clear understanding of the challenges that lie before us, and has proven to be ahead of the curve time and again. All of which is to say, Chris Hedges is unafraid to say what is necessary and true\u2014and has always been. If we are to combat the intellectual and moral decay that have come to grip American life, we must listen to him and the urgent message he brings in this book."}, {"itemid": "BK-VE-HH-1", "subcat": "Books", "name": "Vaccine Epidemic", "img": ["vaccine-epidemic.jpg", "vaccine-epidemic_back.jpg"], "price": "$103.60", "desc": " Vaccine Epidemic: How Corporate Greed, Biased Science, and Coercive Government Threaten Our Human Rights, Our Health, and Our Children is the book big pharma doesn't want you to read.\u00a0 This book takes a full spectrum look at the dangers and unanswered questions about vaccines.\u00a0 It is required  reading for all people contemplating vaccination for themselves and  their children and an  essential handbook for the vaccination choice movement.National polls show that Americans are increasingly concerned about  vaccine safety.\u00a0 Everyone should have the right to make individual, informed choices  together with their healthcare practitioners.

He is an intellectual bomb thrower, who continues to confront American empire in the most incisive, challenging ways. The kinds of insights he provides into the deeply troubled state of our democracy cannot be found anywhere else. Like many of our most important thinkers, he has been relegated to the margins because of ideas deemed too radical\u2014or true\u2014for public consumption. Whether it is covering the dissolution of former Soviet states or embedding in the Middle East to understand the post-9/11 world, he has been a singular voice pushing against mainstream media disinformation and the amnesia of establishment received wisdom. He is an intellectual heir to American radical heroes such as Thomas Paine and Noam Chomsky, and is dedicated to reigniting a shared commitment to radical equality and honesty.Hedges here speaks up about the most pressing issues that currently face our nation. He tackles the rise of a fascist right in support of Donald Trump, which advocates xenophobia and violence in a push for American totalitarianism. He rails against the posturing of inclusivity from establishment elites on both sides of the aisle, who post-Occupy-Wall-Street continue to advocate for policies that make America uninhabitable for all but the ultra-rich and, as lackeys for corporate interests, continue to expand income inequality in all directions. He tears into the contemporary glamorization of the military and the unchecked, unchallenged hawkishness that defines contemporary American foreign policy. Moreover, he shows his support for contemporary revolts against this twisted order\u2014such as Black Lives Matter\u2014that represent Americans refusing to take the destruction of their country lying down. And that\u2019s just the start.He possesses a clear understanding of the challenges that lie before us, and has proven to be ahead of the curve time and again. All of which is to say, Chris Hedges is unafraid to say what is necessary and true\u2014and has always been. If we are to combat the intellectual and moral decay that have come to grip American life, we must listen to him and the urgent message he brings in this book."}, {"itemid": "BK-XG-SQ-1", "subcat": "Media Specials", "name": "Xenogenesis", "img": ["xenogenesis-book-thumbnail.jpg", "xenogenesis-back-thumbnail.jpg"], "price": "$40.00", "desc": " Monsterous creations are being developed with secret technology in labs around the world.

To commemorate the five year anniversary of his historic infiltration of the Bohemian Grove, the occult playground of the global elite, Alex Jones presents his newest film, The Order of Death, an amazing and horrifying look into the rites and rituals of the modern day descendants of Babylonian mystery cults. Jones' Dark Secrets: Inside the Bohemian Grove documented the first ever hidden camera incursion into the Grove and the bizarre pagan ritual, the Cremation of Care, practiced by its members: all men, including both Presidents Bush, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Colin Powell, and Henry Kissenger to name but a few. The Order of Death picks up where Dark Secrets leaves off. This new work exposes the connections between the Bohemian Club and Skull and Bones and other occult secret societies. Jones explores the roots of the Grove and its links to occult networks dating back to ancient Egypt and Babylon. This new film delves deeply into the history of the Grove where powerful men make decisions that affect the world but are completely hidden from public scrutiny. The Order of Death details how the Grove has been the backdrop for some of the most earth-shattering events in human history including the development of the Starwars program and the Manhattan Project.Jones' newest foray into revealing the occult also had him butting heads with local protesters of the Grove who, like the owl-worshippers inside, try to conceal their own occult practices. The Order of Death also features never before seen footage captured by a daring former Grove employee including an astounding look inside the owl worshiped at the Cremation of Care ritual.

In their follow-up to Dead Wrong, authors Richard Belzer and David Wayne are back again to set the record straight; this time they're going to uncover the truth about the many witness deaths tied to the JFK assassination. The simple observation that it is statistically impossible for so many witness deaths to simply be coincidence has dramatic implications.\u00a0 The math indicates that witnesses who \"knew something\" were systematically eliminated. For decades, government pundits have dismissed these \"coincidental\" deaths, even regarding them as \"myths\" or \"urban legends.\"\u00a0 However, this book reveals startling different conclusions.\u00a0 Like most people, Richard and David were initially unsure about what to make of these \"coincidences.\" After all, events don't consult the odds prior to happening; they simply happen. Then someone comes along later and figures out what the odds of it happening were. Some of the deaths seemed purely coincidental; heart attacks, hunting accidents. Others clearly seemed noteworthy; witnesses who did seem to know something and did seem to die mysteriously.Hit List reveals facts and theories about the suspicious deaths of:\n\nJimmy Hoffa\nMary Pinchot Meyer\nJ.

Gumpert that exposes who really decides what we eat.  This book examines the following life or death question:  Do Americans have the right to privately obtain the foods of our choice from farmers, neighbors, and local producers, in the same way our grandparents and great grandparents used to do?  A growing number of people answer yes. These educated and engaged individuals are increasingly afraid that the mass-produced food sold at supermarkets is excessively processed, tainted with antibiotic residues and hormones, and lacking in important nutrients. These people, a million or more, are seeking foods outside the regulatory system, like raw milk, custom-slaughtered beef, and pastured eggs from chickens raised without soy, purchased directly from private membership-only food clubs that contract with Amish and other farmers.  Public-health and agriculture regulators say no: Americans have no inherent right to eat what they want. In today's ever-more-dangerous food-safety environment, they argue, all food, no matter the source, must be closely regulated, and even barred, if it fails to meet certain standards. These regulators, headed up by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with help from state agriculture departments, police, and district-attorney detectives, are mounting intense and sophisticated investigative campaigns against farms and food clubs supplying privately exchanged food-even handcuffing and hauling off to jail, under threat of lengthy prison terms, those deemed in violation of food laws.  Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Food Rights takes readers on a disturbing cross-country journey from Maine to California through a netherworld of Amish farmers paying big fees to questionable advisers to avoid the quagmire of America's legal system, secret food police lurking in vans at farmers markets, cultish activists preaching the benefits of pathogens, U.S. Justice Department lawyers clashing with local sheriffs, small Maine towns passing ordinances to ban regulation, and suburban moms worried enough about the dangers of supermarket food that they'll risk fines and jail to feed their children unprocessed, and unregulated, foods of their choosing.  Out of the intensity of this unprecedented crackdown, and the creative and spirited opposition that is rising to meet it, a new rallying cry for food rights is emerging.

One of the key revelations Quigley reveals is a secret organization created by Englishman Cecil Rhodes.\u00a0 Rhodes was the founder of diamond company De Beers, ardent supporter of British colonialism and creator of the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship that has since educated so many global elite leaders. Funded by Rhodes' estate, the goal of this organization was to consolidate world control into the hands of the English speaking elites.\u00a0 This book ties together how this secret organization of global elites has quietly steered the world towards a goal of global government using collectivism. As an insider with access to many secret documents, Quigley was proud of the achievements of this secret organization and wrote this book from that viewpoint.\u00a0 The book was intended to only be read by fellow academics and other insider intellectuals that shared a similar world view.\u00a0 The book was quickly taken out of print when it became more widely circulated and opponents latched onto it as a confession of the global elite.\u00a0 As pressure mounted, the publishers relented and authorized this identical reissue edition. This book continues to provide one of the most revealing looks into the goals and methodology of the global elite.\u00a0 This book is printed in limited quantities and not readily available at most mainstream bookstores.\u00a0 Infowars is proud to have secured a batch of Tragedy & Hope and to help spread this valuable history and information.Quotes from Tragedy & Hope:\"The powers of financial capitalism had [a] far-reaching aim, nothing  less than to create a world system of financial control in private  hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the  economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a  feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert by  secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and  conferences.\"     -- Carroll Quigley, Chapter 20.\"There  does exist, and has existed for a generation, an international  Anglophile network. I   know of the operations of this network because I have studied it for   twenty years and was permitted for two years, in the early 1960's, to   examine its papers and secret records. I have no  aversion to it or  to most of its aims and have, for much of my life,  been close to it and  to many of its instruments. I have objected, both  in the past and  recently, to a few of its policies ... but in general  my chief difference of opinion is that it  wishes to remain unknown, and  I believe its role in history is  significant enough to be known.\"\u00a0 --Carroll Quigley, Chapter 65."}, {"itemid": "BK-TRLEG-SQ-1", "subcat": "Books", "name": "True Legends - Book", "img": ["true-legends-thumbnail.jpg", "true-legends-back-thumbnail_1.jpg"], "price": "$39.95", "desc": " In 1984, George Orwell wrote of a totalitarian society in which the government constantly revised history in order to make it conform to the claims of the ruling elite. Ironically, our own society has evolved into a similar system of rewriting history. However unlike that society described by Orwell, those rewriting our history have engaged in a much more effective and insidious process, with only a few hints from time to time to suggest anything might be amiss.\nMost citizens in the West spend their whole lifetimes blissfully unaware that they have been fed a carefully edited view of the past, tailored to prop up the powers that be and keep humanity ignorant of their own past and the dangers that the past presents in the here and now. Where Orwell's Big Brother was overtly aggressive in his rule, today's ruling elite are every secretive and hide behind various media outlets, scientific organizations, government offices, and secret societies.\nTheir control is not infinite or complete, but it comes close with only those willing to self publish or post on the Internet generally being able to circumvent their control. Later in this book I will be outlining who these secret rulers are (and have presented a fuller picture of their secrets and goals in my previous books Genesis 6 Giants - Master Builders of Prehistoric and Ancient Civilizations, and Angel Wars: Past, Present, Future).1 In these books I've documented both how there is definitive proof of the existence of giants and other terrifying creatures both in the form of artifacts as well as historical accounts (echoed in mythology) and will also note how the physical proof is regularly spirited away and destroyed or quietly deposited in obscure museums and dark back rooms where the public is never allowed."}, {"itemid": "BK-UNSPEAK-CH-1", "subcat": "Books", "name": "Unspeakable", "img": ["unspeakable.jpg"], "price": "$34.95", "desc": " UNSPEAKABLE\u00a0\nChris Hedges has been telling truth to (and against) power since his earliest days as a radical journalist. He is an intellectual bomb thrower, who continues to confront American empire in the most incisive, challenging ways. The kinds of insights he provides into the deeply troubled state of our democracy cannot be found anywhere else. Like many of our most important thinkers, he has been relegated to the margins because of ideas deemed too radical\u2014or true\u2014for public consumption. Whether it is covering the dissolution of former Soviet states or embedding in the Middle East to understand the post-9/11 world, he has been a singular voice pushing against mainstream media disinformation and the amnesia of establishment received wisdom. He is an intellectual heir to American radical heroes such as Thomas Paine and Noam Chomsky, and is dedicated to reigniting a shared commitment to radical equality and honesty.Hedges here speaks up about the most pressing issues that currently face our nation. He tackles the rise of a fascist right in support of Donald Trump, which advocates xenophobia and violence in a push for American totalitarianism. He rails against the posturing of inclusivity from establishment elites on both sides of the aisle, who post-Occupy-Wall-Street continue to advocate for policies that make America uninhabitable for all but the ultra-rich and, as lackeys for corporate interests, continue to expand income inequality in all directions. He tears into the contemporary glamorization of the military and the unchecked, unchallenged hawkishness that defines contemporary American foreign policy. Moreover, he shows his support for contemporary revolts against this twisted order\u2014such as Black Lives Matter\u2014that represent Americans refusing to take the destruction of their country lying down. And that\u2019s just the start.He possesses a clear understanding of the challenges that lie before us, and has proven to be ahead of the curve time and again. All of which is to say, Chris Hedges is unafraid to say what is necessary and true\u2014and has always been. If we are to combat the intellectual and moral decay that have come to grip American life, we must listen to him and the urgent message he brings in this book."}, {"itemid": "BK-VE-HH-1", "subcat": "Books", "name": "Vaccine Epidemic", "img": ["vaccine-epidemic.jpg", "vaccine-epidemic_back.jpg"], "price": "$103.60", "desc": " Vaccine Epidemic: How Corporate Greed, Biased Science, and Coercive Government Threaten Our Human Rights, Our Health, and Our Children is the book big pharma doesn't want you to read.\u00a0 This book takes a full spectrum look at the dangers and unanswered questions about vaccines.\u00a0 It is required  reading for all people contemplating vaccination for themselves and  their children and an  essential handbook for the vaccination choice movement.National polls show that Americans are increasingly concerned about  vaccine safety.\u00a0 Everyone should have the right to make individual, informed choices  together with their healthcare practitioners.

He is an intellectual bomb thrower, who continues to confront American empire in the most incisive, challenging ways. The kinds of insights he provides into the deeply troubled state of our democracy cannot be found anywhere else. Like many of our most important thinkers, he has been relegated to the margins because of ideas deemed too radical\u2014or true\u2014for public consumption. Whether it is covering the dissolution of former Soviet states or embedding in the Middle East to understand the post-9/11 world, he has been a singular voice pushing against mainstream media disinformation and the amnesia of establishment received wisdom. He is an intellectual heir to American radical heroes such as Thomas Paine and Noam Chomsky, and is dedicated to reigniting a shared commitment to radical equality and honesty.Hedges here speaks up about the most pressing issues that currently face our nation. He tackles the rise of a fascist right in support of Donald Trump, which advocates xenophobia and violence in a push for American totalitarianism. He rails against the posturing of inclusivity from establishment elites on both sides of the aisle, who post-Occupy-Wall-Street continue to advocate for policies that make America uninhabitable for all but the ultra-rich and, as lackeys for corporate interests, continue to expand income inequality in all directions. He tears into the contemporary glamorization of the military and the unchecked, unchallenged hawkishness that defines contemporary American foreign policy. Moreover, he shows his support for contemporary revolts against this twisted order\u2014such as Black Lives Matter\u2014that represent Americans refusing to take the destruction of their country lying down. And that\u2019s just the start.He possesses a clear understanding of the challenges that lie before us, and has proven to be ahead of the curve time and again. All of which is to say, Chris Hedges is unafraid to say what is necessary and true\u2014and has always been. If we are to combat the intellectual and moral decay that have come to grip American life, we must listen to him and the urgent message he brings in this book."}, {"itemid": "BK-XG-SQ-1", "subcat": "Media Specials", "name": "Xenogenesis", "img": ["xenogenesis-book-thumbnail.jpg", "xenogenesis-back-thumbnail.jpg"], "price": "$40.00", "desc": " Monsterous creations are being developed with secret technology in labs around the world.

To commemorate the five year anniversary of his historic infiltration of the Bohemian Grove, the occult playground of the global elite, Alex Jones presents his newest film, The Order of Death, an amazing and horrifying look into the rites and rituals of the modern day descendants of Babylonian mystery cults. Jones' Dark Secrets: Inside the Bohemian Grove documented the first ever hidden camera incursion into the Grove and the bizarre pagan ritual, the Cremation of Care, practiced by its members: all men, including both Presidents Bush, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Colin Powell, and Henry Kissenger to name but a few. The Order of Death picks up where Dark Secrets leaves off. This new work exposes the connections between the Bohemian Club and Skull and Bones and other occult secret societies. Jones explores the roots of the Grove and its links to occult networks dating back to ancient Egypt and Babylon. This new film delves deeply into the history of the Grove where powerful men make decisions that affect the world but are completely hidden from public scrutiny. The Order of Death details how the Grove has been the backdrop for some of the most earth-shattering events in human history including the development of the Starwars program and the Manhattan Project.Jones' newest foray into revealing the occult also had him butting heads with local protesters of the Grove who, like the owl-worshippers inside, try to conceal their own occult practices. The Order of Death also features never before seen footage captured by a daring former Grove employee including an astounding look inside the owl worshiped at the Cremation of Care ritual.
