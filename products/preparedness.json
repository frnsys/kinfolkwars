That means that it catches 99.97% of air contaminants, including allergens, dander, dust, and mold.\nSecond, a filter of activated carbon removes odors caused by smoke, pets, cooking and more. The activated carbon material also traps and eliminates volatile organic chemicals (VOCs). Your Alexapure Breeze air purifier will let you know when the filters need changing with its built in indicator. However, plan to replace these filters every 9 to 12 months if you use your Breeze on a daily basis.\nReplacing your filters regularly helps your Breeze perform at its best. If you\u2019re not getting the air quality you\u2019re used to, it may be time to change them!\nNOTE:  Only replace a filter when the filter replacement light flashes. If you replace the filter before the filter replacement light starts flashing, the lifetime counter will not be reset but will continue counting the lifetime of the previous filter. As a result, the filter replacement light will start flashing much too soon."}, {"itemid": "MPS-AP-PRO-1", "subcat": "Preparedness Specials", "name": "Alexapure Pro Water Filtration System", "img": ["alexapure_pro_25_percent_off.jpg", "alexapure_components.jpg", "_m7a3825.jpg"], "price": "$197.00", "desc": " Introducing Alexapure Pro\u2122 from My Patriot SupplyThe Alexapure Pro\u2122 transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

Even today, herbs remain one  of the primary sources of medical remedies in both modern laboratories  and natural medicine.

Protect your family today with Heirloom Organics Family Medicine Seed Pack.Heirloom Organics Family Medicine Seed Pack contents list: \ufeffAngelica Angelica archangelicaAngelica  has a long tradition of use as a general tonic herb for women,  children, and the elderly. It is said to strengthen the heart and  provide an antidote against general debility. According to legend,  Angelica was revealed in a dream by an angel to cure the plague. All  parts of the plant were believed effective against evil spirits, and  Angelica was held in such esteem that it was called 'The Root of the  Holy Ghost.' In America it was used by the Iroquois and other tribes in  ceremonial medicine, and in traditional lore an infusion of smashed  roots was used as wash to remove ghosts from the house. NOTE  The fresh root of Angelica is not edible, said to be poisonous. Do not  use while pregnant or breastfeeding without consulting your doctor. Boneset Eupatorium perfoliatumBoneset  gets its name from its ability to \"break bone fever.\" Used by North  American Indians for stomach problems, colds, and fevers, in addition to  arthritis and rheumatic ailments. Boneset has also been used to treat  influenza, and is said to alleviate pain and reduce fever associated  with such imbalance.\u00a0 European settlers used it as a cure-all. Boneset?s  odor is weak, but its taste is extremely bitter. NOTE Boneset is toxic in high doses. Calendula Calendula officinalisThe  flower petals of the Calendula plant have been used for medicinal  purposes since at least the 12th century. Native to Mediterranean  countries, Calendula is now cultivated across the globe.\u00a0 Calendula is  typically added to salves and other topical preparations and has been  shown to speed the healing of wounds, where it appears to have  anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antibacterial effects. Chamomile Matricaria recutitaIt  is said that the Egyptians dedicated Chamomile to their sun god and  valued it over all other herbs for its healing qualities. Due to its  sedative and relaxing properties Chamomile was an ingredient in some  love potions of the middle ages. Chamomile flowers are used in  alternative medicine as an anodyne, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic,  nervine, stomachic, tonic, and vasodilator. The anti-inflammatory  properties make it good for rheumatism, arthritis, and other painful  swellings. Echinacea Echinaceae purpureaEchinacea  has been used in North America for more than 400 years to treat  infections and wounds, and as a general \"cure-all.\" Today, people use  Echinacea to shorten the duration of the common cold and flu and reduce  symptoms, such as sore throat (pharyngitis), cough, and fever. Many  herbalists also recommend echinacea to help boost the immune system and  help the body fight infections. Echinacea is well known for its  anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-inflammatory  properties. Feverfew\u00a0 Chrysanthemum partheniumFeverfew  was first introduced to North America by European settlers in the 17th  century, and has long been used to treat headaches and inflammation.\u00a0  Especially renowned as a treatment for migraines, Feverfew has also been  used for menstrual problems such as cramping and irregularity. It can  also be taken for problems such as joint pain and rheumatism. NOTE  Feverfew should not be used during pregnancy because of the stimulant  action on the womb. The fresh leaves may cause mouth ulcers in sensitive  people. Mullein Verbascum olympicumThe  Greeks, Romans, British and Native Americans have all used Mullein to  treat a number of respiratory conditions, from a mild cough to  bronchitis and asthma. The dried stalks of Mullein have also been used  as torches. The flowers can be used to create bright yellow or green  dyes, which were used by the ancient Romans to color hair, according to  \"Healing Teas\" by Marie Nadine Antol. Greek mythology holds that Ulysses  carried Mullein to protect himself from the evil Circe. For these  purposes the leaves can be smoked or used to prepare tea. NOTE Mullein causes allergic reactions in a small population. Nettle\u00a0 Urtica dioicaIn  medieval Europe Stinging nettle\u00a0 was used as a diuretic (to rid the  body of excess water) and to treat joint pain. Stinging nettle has been  used for hundreds of years to treat painful muscles and joints, eczema,  arthritis, gout, and anemia. Today, many people use it to treat urinary  problems during the early stages of an enlarged prostate, for urinary  tract infections, for hay fever, or in compresses or creams for treating  joint pain, sprains and strains, tendonitis, and insect bites. NOTE Do  not use while pregnant or breastfeeding without consulting your doctor.  Stinging nettle should never be applied to an open wound. Be careful  when handling the nettle plant because touching it can cause an allergic  rash. Occasional side effects include mild stomach upset, fluid  retention, and hives or rash (mainly from topical use). Pleurisy Root Asclepias tuberosaSome  Native American legends tell of the roots being used as a body wash for  lifting and running strength. Also used as a drug in chant lotion, and  as a ceremonial emetic. Asclepias tuberosa has a long history of use as a  valuable alternative medicine and is one of the most important of the  indigenous American species. Butterfly Weed is used internally in the  treatment of diarrhea, dysentery, chronic rheumatism, and as an  expectorant. It has a specific action on the lungs, making it a valuable  medicinal herb in all chest complaints and in the treatment of many  lung diseases. Skullcap Scutellaria laterifloraSkullcap  was well known among the Cherokee and other Native American healers as a  strong emmenagogue and female medicinal herb. Today Skullcap is  recognized as a powerful medicinal herb, used in alternative medicine as  an anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, slightly astringent, emmenagogue,  febrifuge, nervine, sedative and tonic.\u00a0 NOTE Should  be used with some caution since in overdose it causes giddiness,  stupor, confusion and twitching. Skullcap has been linked to liver  damage, though it is suspected that the source of damage was actually  from Germander being substituted for Skullcap. Use in moderation and  avoid if you have liver problems. Spikenard Aralia racemosaSpikenard  was a popular herb among American Indians, who gathered its pleasantly  scented roots for a variety of medicinal uses. Herbalists record that  the Cherokees drank Spikenard tea for backache and that the Shawnees  used it to treat gas pains, coughs, asthma, and chest pains. Other  tribes gave the tea to women in labor to make childbirth swifter and  less painful. The Micmacs reportedly applied a salve of spikenard to  cuts and wounds, while the Ojibwas used the root in a poultice for  healing broken bones. Early settlers used the juice from the dark purple  berries and oil from the seeds.\u00a0 Medical practitioners in the 19th  century prescribed the root to treat gout, rheumatism, syphilis, and  other diseases in which it was deemed necessary to \"purify the blood.\"  More recently, Spikenard has gained popularity as an adaptogen, sharing  many common properties with its close relative American Ginseng. Tobacco Nicotiana rusticaNicotiana  rustica is also known as Sacred Tobacco, Mapacho, Aztec tobacco and a  host of other names. It originated in Mexico but was widely cultivated  throughout the Americas by native peoples for ceremonial purposes.\u00a0  Mapacho is considered very sacred by Amazonian shamans and is employed  alone or in combination with other plants in shamanic practices. Some  shamans drink the juice of tobac\r\no leaves alone as a source of visions.  Mapacho is used extensively in healing practices and is considered a  medicine, not a health hazard, when used properly. The Tukanoan peoples  of the Vaup\u00e9s often rub a decoction of the leaves briskly over sprains  and bruises. Amongst the Witotos and Boras, fresh leaves are crushed and  poulticed over boils and infected wounds. Tikuna men mix the crushed  leaves with the oil from palms to rub into the hair to prevent balding.  The Jivaros take tobacco juice therapeutically for indisposition, chills  and snake bites. In many tribes tobacco snuff may be employed  medicinally for a variety of ills, particularly to treat pulmonary  ailments.The herbal information on this web site is intended for  educational purposes only.

From cereals to breads of all kinds, cakes, pies, porridges; for brewing beer and other beverages or even feeding livestock. The Heirloom Organics Non-Hybrid Grains Pack provides the most nutritious and delicious original grain varieties available. A healthy selection of traditional grains, prepared with the exclusive Heirloom Organics' Vault method of long-term storage preparation and sealed into a recloseable green pail. The Heirloom Organics Grains Pack provides whole grains that supply vitamin E and B vitamins such as folic acid, as well as minerals like magnesium, iron, and zinc. Every sustainable garden plan should include a healthy supply of grains.Heirloom Organics Grains Seed Pack contents:\n\n\nSoft White Wheat - 8 oz Soft White Wheat is a preferred wheat for flat breads, cakes, pastries, crackers and noodles and is grown primarily in the Pacific Northwest. It has a softer, milder taste than the hard wheats.\n\u00a0\n Hard Red Wheat - 8 oz Flour from hard red wheat is considered \"classic\" whole wheat. While other varieties of wheat can be made into \"whole wheat flour\" this is the flour that gives bread a rich brown color and a nutty wheat flavor.\n\nOats - 8 oz Oats have been cultivated for near 5,000 years. Oats are nourishing as they provide starch, vitamins, minerals and proteins. They also have some amount of low saturated fat. This is why oat is considered a beneficial food item.\n\u00a0\nBarley - 8 oz Barley is a wonderfully versatile cereal grain with a rich nutlike flavor and an appealing chewy, pasta-like consistency.\n\u00a0\nFlax - 4 oz The warm, earthy and subtly nutty flavor of flaxseeds combined with an abundance of omega-3 fatty acids makes them an increasingly popular addition to the diets of many a health conscious consumer.\n\u00a0\nMillet - 4 oz Creamy like mashed potatoes or fluffy like rice, millet is a delicious grain that can accompany many types of food. Millet is one of the oldest foods known to humans and possibly the first cereal grain to be used for domestic purposes.\n\u00a0\nRye - 8 oz Rye is one of the most reliable and easy-to-grow grains. It is most often ground into flour and used to make hearty pumpernickel and rye breads. This seed can also be broadcast under knee high corn in early summer, or simply used as a cover crop in your garden.\n\u00a0\nCorn - 4 oz Throughout Europe, \"corn\" has always been the generic name for any of the cereal grains; Europeans call corn maize, a derivative of the early American Indian word mahiz. Corn is not only a popular food, but the foundation of many by-products including bourbon, corn flour, cornmeal, corn oil, cornstarch, corn syrup, corn whiskey and laundry starch.\nAmaranth - 1 oz Amaranth Grain dates back hundreds of years to the Aztecs in Mexico. It offers an unusually high quality protein and is high quality protein and is high in fiber. Amaranth Grain has a nutty flavor and can be combined with wheat flour in breads, pasta, pancakes and other recipes.\n\u00a0\nDue to ongoing seed shortages, seed varieties subject to change without notice.

Tomatillo varieties include De Milpa, Purple and Verde.\n\u00a0\nYellow PlumYellow Plum tomatoes are flavorful and make a great slicer. Healthy plants will produce good quantities of the small, plum-shaped fruits. Indeterminate growers typically require 75-80 days to reach maturity after transplanting.\n\u00a0\nDue to ongoing seed shortages, seed varieties subject to change without notice. Replacements will be as close as possible and will be included in your order documentation.\nInternational Customers: Import laws vary from country to country.

The activated carbon material also traps and eliminates volatile organic chemicals (VOCs). Your Alexapure Breeze air purifier will let you know when the filters need changing with its built in indicator. However, plan to replace these filters every 9 to 12 months if you use your Breeze on a daily basis.\nReplacing your filters regularly helps your Breeze perform at its best. If you\u2019re not getting the air quality you\u2019re used to, it may be time to change them!\nNOTE:  Only replace a filter when the filter replacement light flashes.

Water is forced through narrow fibers under high pressure. Clean water exits through tiny pores in the walls of the hollow fibers, but bacteria, viruses, protozoa and other contaminants are trapped inside the hollow fibers and are flushed out by backwashing. This is a highly efficient method of filtration.\n\nThe feed water bucket (2 liter capacity) is filled with water.\nThe 80-micron textile pre-filter (inside the feed water bucket) removes coarser particles and is easy to clean.\nWater passes through the meter-long blue PVC hose and gravity creates sufficient pressure on the membrane cartridge in order to reach a high flow rate.\nUltra filtration takes place in the hollow fiber membrane cartridge - a pore size of 20 nanometers (0.02 microns) retains bacteria, viruses, parasites and fine dirt particles.\nThe blue tap is turned to release purified water.\nBackwash the membrane by squeezing the red backwash bulb 3 times with both taps closed and then releasing the dirty water from the red tap. Water from the red tap should never be consumed.\n\n\n\nThe Science Behind LifeStraw:\nBacked by serious research in our international labs and extensive testing in the field, LifeStraw and LifeStraw Family have been distributed to nearly every major international humanitarian disaster since 2005 and in broad public health campaigns in the millions.\nThe same high-tech design used in places like Haiti, Indonesia, South Africa, Kenya, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and Bangladesh is now available in the USA and Canada.

Since dissolved ionized solids such as salts and minerals increase the conductivity of a solution, a TDS meter measures the conductivity of the solution and estimates the TDS from that. A TDS meter typically displays the TDS in parts per million (ppm). For example, a TDS reading of 1 ppm would indicate there is 1 milligram of dissolved solids in each kilogram of water. TDS is a measure of total dissolved solids and NOT dissolved contaminants. A higher TDS can simply be high calcium or mineral content. As Propur filters are made from minerals, TDS may be higher after the water has been treated. This does not mean the filter isn't working, it means the TDS meter is picking up the minerals that are naturally released by the filter. A PPM meter is the same as a TDS meter, it is simply measures dissolved solids in water. A TDS meter is not generally recognized in the industry as a proper means of testing water for contaminants. They were created years ago by the manufacturers of reverse osmosis systems as a means of demonstrating the effectiveness of RO which removes most if not all minerals.\"*The removal/reduction of contaminants or other substances, filter replacement period and/or life expectancy in gallons may vary depending on the level of contaminants present in your water supply. Some contaminants may be more easily filtered than others. Based on average daily water consumption and optimal fluoride levels recommended by the US Public Health Service and CDC for drinking water.**INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS:\u00a0 Please select USPS Priority Mail International to receive correct shipping rate.\u00a0 International orders without this shipping method selected may be delayed or cancelled.\u00a0 You may contact Infowars customer service at 1-888-253-3139 or by email at [email\u00a0protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ if you have any questions.** ***Propur products ship directly from the manufacturer, separate from other Infowars products you may also order.

It is designed to deliver the natural benefits of nutritionally dense brown seaweed in a form that is easy to digest.\u00a0 Modifilan is not just another dry seaweed product, it is a highly concentrated product.\u00a0 It takes forty pounds of raw seaweed is needed to make one pound of Modifilan.\u00a0 There are more than 70 nutritional mineral values found in brown seaweed making Modifilan a great addition to healthy eating habits.\u00a0 Brown seaweed extract contains numerous beneficial properties such as Organic Iodine, Alginates, Fucoidan, and Laminarin.\n\nAlginates may help to detoxify and cleanse the body. It has the ability of binding heavy metals and radioactive elements to its own molecules and secreting them from the body. \nOrganic iodine promotes a healthy thyroid gland which controls metabolism and promotes maturation of the nervous system. \nFucoidanis a polysaccharide found in seaweed which may help to stimulate the immune system and may help to naturally eliminate harmful cells.\nLaminarin is also a polysaccharide that may support cardiovascular health.\n\nOriginally developed by Russian scientists as a remedy for heavy metal and radiation poisoning, Modifilan was used during the Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe.\u00a0 Originally the Laminaria Japonica brown seaweed was harvested in the North Pacific ocean.\u00a0 However, Modifilan is now obtaining its raw seaweed from Tasmania (King Island and Flinders Island areas) due to the environmental concerns resulting from Fukushima and increasing Russian interference.\u00a0 Modifilan does not sell direct to public, only through a limited number of approved vendors.

However, plan to replace these filters every 9 to 12 months if you use your Breeze on a daily basis.\nReplacing your filters regularly helps your Breeze perform at its best. If you\u2019re not getting the air quality you\u2019re used to, it may be time to change them!\nNOTE:  Only replace a filter when the filter replacement light flashes. If you replace the filter before the filter replacement light starts flashing, the lifetime counter will not be reset but will continue counting the lifetime of the previous filter. As a result, the filter replacement light will start flashing much too soon."}, {"itemid": "MPS-AP-PRO-1", "subcat": "Preparedness Specials", "name": "Alexapure Pro Water Filtration System", "img": ["alexapure_pro_25_percent_off.jpg", "alexapure_components.jpg", "_m7a3825.jpg"], "price": "$197.00", "desc": " Introducing Alexapure Pro\u2122 from My Patriot SupplyThe Alexapure Pro\u2122 transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

Even today, herbs remain one  of the primary sources of medical remedies in both modern laboratories  and natural medicine.

This package includes an  excellent selection chosen both for ease of growth and popularity of  remedy. Protect your family today with Heirloom Organics Family Medicine Seed Pack.Heirloom Organics Family Medicine Seed Pack contents list: \ufeffAngelica Angelica archangelicaAngelica  has a long tradition of use as a general tonic herb for women,  children, and the elderly. It is said to strengthen the heart and  provide an antidote against general debility. According to legend,  Angelica was revealed in a dream by an angel to cure the plague. All  parts of the plant were believed effective against evil spirits, and  Angelica was held in such esteem that it was called 'The Root of the  Holy Ghost.' In America it was used by the Iroquois and other tribes in  ceremonial medicine, and in traditional lore an infusion of smashed  roots was used as wash to remove ghosts from the house. NOTE  The fresh root of Angelica is not edible, said to be poisonous. Do not  use while pregnant or breastfeeding without consulting your doctor. Boneset Eupatorium perfoliatumBoneset  gets its name from its ability to \"break bone fever.\" Used by North  American Indians for stomach problems, colds, and fevers, in addition to  arthritis and rheumatic ailments. Boneset has also been used to treat  influenza, and is said to alleviate pain and reduce fever associated  with such imbalance.\u00a0 European settlers used it as a cure-all. Boneset?s  odor is weak, but its taste is extremely bitter. NOTE Boneset is toxic in high doses. Calendula Calendula officinalisThe  flower petals of the Calendula plant have been used for medicinal  purposes since at least the 12th century. Native to Mediterranean  countries, Calendula is now cultivated across the globe.\u00a0 Calendula is  typically added to salves and other topical preparations and has been  shown to speed the healing of wounds, where it appears to have  anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antibacterial effects. Chamomile Matricaria recutitaIt  is said that the Egyptians dedicated Chamomile to their sun god and  valued it over all other herbs for its healing qualities. Due to its  sedative and relaxing properties Chamomile was an ingredient in some  love potions of the middle ages. Chamomile flowers are used in  alternative medicine as an anodyne, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic,  nervine, stomachic, tonic, and vasodilator. The anti-inflammatory  properties make it good for rheumatism, arthritis, and other painful  swellings. Echinacea Echinaceae purpureaEchinacea  has been used in North America for more than 400 years to treat  infections and wounds, and as a general \"cure-all.\" Today, people use  Echinacea to shorten the duration of the common cold and flu and reduce  symptoms, such as sore throat (pharyngitis), cough, and fever. Many  herbalists also recommend echinacea to help boost the immune system and  help the body fight infections. Echinacea is well known for its  anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-inflammatory  properties. Feverfew\u00a0 Chrysanthemum partheniumFeverfew  was first introduced to North America by European settlers in the 17th  century, and has long been used to treat headaches and inflammation.\u00a0  Especially renowned as a treatment for migraines, Feverfew has also been  used for menstrual problems such as cramping and irregularity. It can  also be taken for problems such as joint pain and rheumatism. NOTE  Feverfew should not be used during pregnancy because of the stimulant  action on the womb. The fresh leaves may cause mouth ulcers in sensitive  people. Mullein Verbascum olympicumThe  Greeks, Romans, British and Native Americans have all used Mullein to  treat a number of respiratory conditions, from a mild cough to  bronchitis and asthma. The dried stalks of Mullein have also been used  as torches. The flowers can be used to create bright yellow or green  dyes, which were used by the ancient Romans to color hair, according to  \"Healing Teas\" by Marie Nadine Antol. Greek mythology holds that Ulysses  carried Mullein to protect himself from the evil Circe. For these  purposes the leaves can be smoked or used to prepare tea. NOTE Mullein causes allergic reactions in a small population. Nettle\u00a0 Urtica dioicaIn  medieval Europe Stinging nettle\u00a0 was used as a diuretic (to rid the  body of excess water) and to treat joint pain. Stinging nettle has been  used for hundreds of years to treat painful muscles and joints, eczema,  arthritis, gout, and anemia. Today, many people use it to treat urinary  problems during the early stages of an enlarged prostate, for urinary  tract infections, for hay fever, or in compresses or creams for treating  joint pain, sprains and strains, tendonitis, and insect bites. NOTE Do  not use while pregnant or breastfeeding without consulting your doctor.  Stinging nettle should never be applied to an open wound. Be careful  when handling the nettle plant because touching it can cause an allergic  rash. Occasional side effects include mild stomach upset, fluid  retention, and hives or rash (mainly from topical use). Pleurisy Root Asclepias tuberosaSome  Native American legends tell of the roots being used as a body wash for  lifting and running strength. Also used as a drug in chant lotion, and  as a ceremonial emetic. Asclepias tuberosa has a long history of use as a  valuable alternative medicine and is one of the most important of the  indigenous American species. Butterfly Weed is used internally in the  treatment of diarrhea, dysentery, chronic rheumatism, and as an  expectorant. It has a specific action on the lungs, making it a valuable  medicinal herb in all chest complaints and in the treatment of many  lung diseases. Skullcap Scutellaria laterifloraSkullcap  was well known among the Cherokee and other Native American healers as a  strong emmenagogue and female medicinal herb. Today Skullcap is  recognized as a powerful medicinal herb, used in alternative medicine as  an anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, slightly astringent, emmenagogue,  febrifuge, nervine, sedative and tonic.\u00a0 NOTE Should  be used with some caution since in overdose it causes giddiness,  stupor, confusion and twitching. Skullcap has been linked to liver  damage, though it is suspected that the source of damage was actually  from Germander being substituted for Skullcap. Use in moderation and  avoid if you have liver problems. Spikenard Aralia racemosaSpikenard  was a popular herb among American Indians, who gathered its pleasantly  scented roots for a variety of medicinal uses. Herbalists record that  the Cherokees drank Spikenard tea for backache and that the Shawnees  used it to treat gas pains, coughs, asthma, and chest pains. Other  tribes gave the tea to women in labor to make childbirth swifter and  less painful. The Micmacs reportedly applied a salve of spikenard to  cuts and wounds, while the Ojibwas used the root in a poultice for  healing broken bones. Early settlers used the juice from the dark purple  berries and oil from the seeds.\u00a0 Medical practitioners in the 19th  century prescribed the root to treat gout, rheumatism, syphilis, and  other diseases in which it was deemed necessary to \"purify the blood.\"  More recently, Spikenard has gained popularity as an adaptogen, sharing  many common properties with its close relative American Ginseng. Tobacco Nicotiana rusticaNicotiana  rustica is also known as Sacred Tobacco, Mapacho, Aztec tobacco and a  host of other names. It originated in Mexico but was widely cultivated  throughout the Americas by native peoples for ceremonial purposes.\u00a0  Mapacho is considered very sacred by Amazonian shamans and is employed  alone or in combination with other plants in shamanic practices. Some  shamans drink the juice of tobac\r\no leaves alone as a source of visions.  Mapacho is used extensively in healing practices and is considered a  medicine, not a health hazard, when used properly. The Tukanoan peoples  of the Vaup\u00e9s often rub a decoction of the leaves briskly over sprains  and bruises. Amongst the Witotos and Boras, fresh leaves are crushed and  poulticed over boils and infected wounds. Tikuna men mix the crushed  leaves with the oil from palms to rub into the hair to prevent balding.  The Jivaros take tobacco juice therapeutically for indisposition, chills  and snake bites. In many tribes tobacco snuff may be employed  medicinally for a variety of ills, particularly to treat pulmonary  ailments.The herbal information on this web site is intended for  educational purposes only.

From cereals to breads of all kinds, cakes, pies, porridges; for brewing beer and other beverages or even feeding livestock. The Heirloom Organics Non-Hybrid Grains Pack provides the most nutritious and delicious original grain varieties available. A healthy selection of traditional grains, prepared with the exclusive Heirloom Organics' Vault method of long-term storage preparation and sealed into a recloseable green pail. The Heirloom Organics Grains Pack provides whole grains that supply vitamin E and B vitamins such as folic acid, as well as minerals like magnesium, iron, and zinc. Every sustainable garden plan should include a healthy supply of grains.Heirloom Organics Grains Seed Pack contents:\n\n\nSoft White Wheat - 8 oz Soft White Wheat is a preferred wheat for flat breads, cakes, pastries, crackers and noodles and is grown primarily in the Pacific Northwest. It has a softer, milder taste than the hard wheats.\n\u00a0\n Hard Red Wheat - 8 oz Flour from hard red wheat is considered \"classic\" whole wheat. While other varieties of wheat can be made into \"whole wheat flour\" this is the flour that gives bread a rich brown color and a nutty wheat flavor.\n\nOats - 8 oz Oats have been cultivated for near 5,000 years. Oats are nourishing as they provide starch, vitamins, minerals and proteins. They also have some amount of low saturated fat. This is why oat is considered a beneficial food item.\n\u00a0\nBarley - 8 oz Barley is a wonderfully versatile cereal grain with a rich nutlike flavor and an appealing chewy, pasta-like consistency.\n\u00a0\nFlax - 4 oz The warm, earthy and subtly nutty flavor of flaxseeds combined with an abundance of omega-3 fatty acids makes them an increasingly popular addition to the diets of many a health conscious consumer.\n\u00a0\nMillet - 4 oz Creamy like mashed potatoes or fluffy like rice, millet is a delicious grain that can accompany many types of food. Millet is one of the oldest foods known to humans and possibly the first cereal grain to be used for domestic purposes.\n\u00a0\nRye - 8 oz Rye is one of the most reliable and easy-to-grow grains. It is most often ground into flour and used to make hearty pumpernickel and rye breads. This seed can also be broadcast under knee high corn in early summer, or simply used as a cover crop in your garden.\n\u00a0\nCorn - 4 oz Throughout Europe, \"corn\" has always been the generic name for any of the cereal grains; Europeans call corn maize, a derivative of the early American Indian word mahiz. Corn is not only a popular food, but the foundation of many by-products including bourbon, corn flour, cornmeal, corn oil, cornstarch, corn syrup, corn whiskey and laundry starch.\nAmaranth - 1 oz Amaranth Grain dates back hundreds of years to the Aztecs in Mexico. It offers an unusually high quality protein and is high quality protein and is high in fiber. Amaranth Grain has a nutty flavor and can be combined with wheat flour in breads, pasta, pancakes and other recipes.\n\u00a0\nDue to ongoing seed shortages, seed varieties subject to change without notice.

The activated carbon material also traps and eliminates volatile organic chemicals (VOCs). Your Alexapure Breeze air purifier will let you know when the filters need changing with its built in indicator. However, plan to replace these filters every 9 to 12 months if you use your Breeze on a daily basis.\nReplacing your filters regularly helps your Breeze perform at its best. If you\u2019re not getting the air quality you\u2019re used to, it may be time to change them!\nNOTE:  Only replace a filter when the filter replacement light flashes. If you replace the filter before the filter replacement light starts flashing, the lifetime counter will not be reset but will continue counting the lifetime of the previous filter.

Now you can have cold, truly filtered water at your fingertips.\u00a0 The filter is gravity fed so just fill up the\u00a0reservoir\u00a0and wait for the water to filter itself while it chills in the fridge.\u00a0 Never has getting clean, great tasting tap water been any easier or more convenient. \u00a0\n\nClick HERE for official test results.\nPurchase a Clearly Filtered Water Pitcher Relacement Filter.\n\n\u00a0\nThe Clearly Filtered Water Pitcher blows away the mainline competition, see for yourself:\n Care Instructions:\nThe greatest part about Clearly Filtered products is the filter doesn't need to be cleaned.\u00a0 The products are designed not to require regular maintenance. The material inside is made from medical grade plastic that prevents mold from growing inside the filter.\n\nHere are a couple suggestions to keep your filtered pitcher in tip-top shape:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do not use soap on the filter.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do not place filter in dishwasher.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do not place pitcher in freezer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do not use with hot water.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do not use with salt water.\n\nWhen to replace the filter?

It's useful to have at home to purify contaminated tap water in the event of boil water advisories or emergency situations. In a worst-case scenario, you can rely on the LifeStraw Family to purify water from any freshwater source near your home.\nLightweight and portable, LifeStraw Family is perfect for point-of-use water filtration while travelling or camping in remote areas. It makes filtering water a breeze at base camps, while vehicle camping or camping with groups.\nFeatures & Benefits:\n\nFilters up to 4,750 gallons or 18,000 liters of water to 0.02 microns (20 nm)\nRemoves minimum 99.999% of viruses (>LOG 5 reduction)\nRemoves minimum 99.9999% of bacteria (>LOG 6 reduction)\nRemoves minimum 99.99% of protozoan cysts (>LOG 4 reduction)\nRequires no electrical power, batteries, or replacement parts\nRequires no running water or piped-in water supply\nFlow-rate of 9-12 liters/hour\nHas an easy-to-clean pre-filter and purification cartridge\nAll raw materials are US FDA compliant or equivalent\nInternationally recognized & award-winning water filter\nUsed worldwide in harsh conditions since 2005\n\n\u00a0\nHow LifeStraw Family Works: \nLifeStraw Family uses advanced hollow fiber technology. Water is forced through narrow fibers under high pressure. Clean water exits through tiny pores in the walls of the hollow fibers, but bacteria, viruses, protozoa and other contaminants are trapped inside the hollow fibers and are flushed out by backwashing. This is a highly efficient method of filtration.\n\nThe feed water bucket (2 liter capacity) is filled with water.\nThe 80-micron textile pre-filter (inside the feed water bucket) removes coarser particles and is easy to clean.\nWater passes through the meter-long blue PVC hose and gravity creates sufficient pressure on the membrane cartridge in order to reach a high flow rate.\nUltra filtration takes place in the hollow fiber membrane cartridge - a pore size of 20 nanometers (0.02 microns) retains bacteria, viruses, parasites and fine dirt particles.\nThe blue tap is turned to release purified water.\nBackwash the membrane by squeezing the red backwash bulb 3 times with both taps closed and then releasing the dirty water from the red tap. Water from the red tap should never be consumed.\n\n\n\nThe Science Behind LifeStraw:\nBacked by serious research in our international labs and extensive testing in the field, LifeStraw and LifeStraw Family have been distributed to nearly every major international humanitarian disaster since 2005 and in broad public health campaigns in the millions.\nThe same high-tech design used in places like Haiti, Indonesia, South Africa, Kenya, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and Bangladesh is now available in the USA and Canada.

For complete lab report details, please visit our website propurusa.com.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNow here's why the ProOne\u00ae G2.0 is technically advanced over other gravity filters:\n\nYou don't need to prime the ProOne\u00ae G2.0 filter - It doesn't make sense if you're trying to filter out contaminants in your water, why use contaminated water to prime your filters\u00a0\nThere's no need to buy any additional device to prime your filters\u00a0\nFluoride, arsenic and other heavy metals are reduced/removed by a process called absorption using a specially formulated carbon based granular media inside the ProOne\u00ae G2.0, not alumina as used by other manufacturers in their add-on filters.\u00a0\n\nThe ProOne\u00ae G2.0 is silver infused which helps prevent the growth of bacteria\u00a0\n\n\nLeaves good minerals, including calcium, in water\n\n\nThe ProOne\u00ae G2.0 ALL-IN-ONE filter ADVANTAG:\n\nNo need to purchase and attach add-on filters to remove fluoride, arsenic or other heavy metals\u00a0\nNo add-on filters hang down into the water storage container that could leach into your drinking water\u00a0\nNo add-on filters to slow down flow rate\u00a0\nNo add-on filters that require frequent replacement and expense\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nProOne\u00ae\u00a0M G2.0 Water Filter Pitcher -- Recommended Replacement at 6 months per filter\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nVisit the\u00a0ProOne G2.0 Technical Information Page for more detailed information.\u00a0 Filtration rate:\u00a0 IMPORTANT--you can not rush quality.\u00a0 This may be the most thorough filtered water pitcher on the market; however it is not the fastest.\u00a0 Whereas many brands will filter a batch in minutes, the Propur Water Filter Pitcher will take hours.\u00a0 It is recommended to fill it up before bed and you will have a fresh batch of Propurified water in the morning.\u00a0 You need to allow the batch to completely process before attempting to pour.A word about TDS and PPM: From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \u201cA TDS Meter indicates the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) of a solution, i.e. the concentration of dissolved solids in it. Since dissolved ionized solids such as salts and minerals increase the conductivity of a solution, a TDS meter measures the conductivity of the solution and estimates the TDS from that. A TDS meter typically displays the TDS in parts per million (ppm). For example, a TDS reading of 1 ppm would indicate there is 1 milligram of dissolved solids in each kilogram of water. TDS is a measure of total dissolved solids and NOT dissolved contaminants. A higher TDS can simply be high calcium or mineral content. As Propur filters are made from minerals, TDS may be higher after the water has been treated. This does not mean the filter isn't working, it means the TDS meter is picking up the minerals that are naturally released by the filter. A PPM meter is the same as a TDS meter, it is simply measures dissolved solids in water. A TDS meter is not generally recognized in the industry as a proper means of testing water for contaminants. They were created years ago by the manufacturers of reverse osmosis systems as a means of demonstrating the effectiveness of RO which removes most if not all minerals.\"*The removal/reduction of contaminants or other substances, filter replacement period and/or life expectancy in gallons may vary depending on the level of contaminants present in your water supply. Some contaminants may be more easily filtered than others. Based on average daily water consumption and optimal fluoride levels recommended by the US Public Health Service and CDC for drinking water.**INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS:\u00a0 Please select USPS Priority Mail International to receive correct shipping rate.\u00a0 International orders without this shipping method selected may be delayed or cancelled.\u00a0 You may contact Infowars customer service at 1-888-253-3139 or by email at [email\u00a0protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ if you have any questions.** ***Propur products ship directly from the manufacturer, separate from other Infowars products you may also order.

Propur has taken great care in designing a non-drip spigot and the housing around the filter itself to avoid leakage and defect problems.\u00a0 Like allPropur products, it is backed by their guarantee of customer satisfaction. **INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS:\u00a0 Please select USPS Priority Mail International to receive correct shipping rate.\u00a0 International orders without this shipping method selected may be delayed or cancelled.\u00a0 You may contact Infowars customer service at 1-888-253-3139 or by email at [email\u00a0protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ if you have any questions.** ***Propur products ship directly from the manufacturer, separate from other Infowars products you may also order.
