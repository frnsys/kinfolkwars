Try to incorporate the following dietary guidelines to reduce your toxin exposure while cleansing.\n\nTry to purchase organic or locally grown foods as conventional foods are often over-processed, sprayed with pesticides, or grown in nutrient depleted soil.\nTry to include healthy oils in your diet such as coconut, hemp, flax seed, or olive.\nAvoid cow's milk and cheese during the cleanse, instead try almond or hemp milk.\nAvoid foods that contain gluten, such as cereal grains, wheat, barley, white flour, pasta, bread, couscous, flour, tortillas, cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, chips, imitation fish, hot dogs, and fried foods.\nAvoid alcoholic beverages.\nAvoid diet sodas and other products often contain artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame, neotame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Substitute with natural sweeteners such as honey, stevia, or coconut sugar.\nAvoid foods that contain high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, molasses, white sugar, dextrose, sorbitol, processed fructose, and sucrose.\nReplace table salt (sodium chloride) with himalayan salt.\nAvoid soy products. Most soy contains pesticide residue and is genetically modified. Soybeans are also high in phytic acid which is damaging to the digestive tract and blocks the absorption of nutrients and essential minerals.\nCaffeine, in moderation, is acceptable during your cleanse. Try organic tea or coffee without creamers and use natural sweeteners such as raw honey.\n\nWhat To Expect During Your Liver Cleanse\nOxy-Powder can cause watery stools, so make sure a bathroom is nearby. If your stools are liquid, remember this is not diarrhea but the result of turning solid compacted fecal matter in the intestinal tract into a liquid or gas.\nA small percentage of people may experience what is known as a healing crisis. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. Don't get discouraged.\nBefore You Start: Prepare Your Liver Cleanse Formula\nThe night before you start your cleanse, make the following 2 gallons and try to go to bed before 9pm to get a good night's rest.\nHow to Make the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula\n\nMaking Gallon #1: Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula: Pour out 3 ounces from your 1st gallon of distilled or purified water and add all of the Liver Shield formula and 2 tablespoons of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). Shake and refrigerate.\nMaking Gallon #2: Water/Apple Cider Vinegar Mixture (ACV): Pour out 2 ounces from your 2nd gallon of distilled or purified drinking water and add 1 ounce of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar. Shake and refrigerate.\n\nDay 1 - Start Your Liver Cleanse\n\n8:00am: Eat a healthy Breakfast Option (see breakfast diet options from day 1-4). Do not mix the fruits!\n9:00am: Drink one 8-ounce glass of Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n10:00-11:00am: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n12:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n1:00pm: Eat healthy Lunch Meal (see lunch diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your lunch meal.\n3:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n4:00-5:00pm: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n6:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n7:00pm: Eat healthy Dinner Meal (see dinner diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your dinner meal.\n8:00-10:00pm: Before bed, take 4 capsules of Oxy-Powder. Do not go to bed past 10pm!\n\nDays Two, Three, and Four of Your Liver Cleanse\nFollow the same instructions as Day 1, however, from 8:00-10:00pm: take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder.\nDay 5 of Your Liver Cleanse - Flush Day\u009d\n8:00am to 10:00am - Breakfast Meal (see breakfast diet options for day 5). Do not mix the fruits! We recommend using watermelon if it is available due to its high glutathione content.\nAfter breakfast, start preparing your Liver Cleanse Soup for lunch (see the recipe below) if you choose Option #1. Drink the Water/ACV Mixture as needed until lunch.\n12:00pm - Liver Supporting Lunch Meal. Choose from one of the following 3 options for your lunch meal:\nOption #1 - Liver Cleanse Soup (Recommended)\nTo maximize the liver's ability to detox and cleanse, choose a combination of foods which are high in naturally occurring sulphur and glutathione. Sulphur helps the liver cleanse harmful chemicals.\nThe ingredients in the liver cleanse soup include the following:\n\n1 Organic Beet (Washed and Chopped)\n2 Organic Carrots (Chopped)\n1 Cup Broccoli (Chopped)\n10 Organic Garlic Cloves (Minced)\n\u00bd Organic Onion (Chopped)\n\u00bc Organic Lemon\n2 Bay Leaves\n1 Teaspoon Himalayan Crystal Salt\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Turmeric\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Oregano\nOther liver cleansing foods you can use:artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, kale, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower can be added to the soup.\n\nTo prepare the Liver Cleanse Soup: Wash vegetables. Finely chop ingredients to desired consistency. Pour 32 ounces of distilled or purified water into a soup pot. Add all of the ingredients to the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and then simmer on low heat for one hour. Eat this soup for your lunch meal. After your meal, refrigerate the remaining portion of your soup for tomorrow's lunch meal (Day 6).\nOption #2 - Beet/Carrot Juice (Alternate):\n\nPeel and juice ingredients in a blender until desired consistency is achieved.\n3 Organic Carrots (washed and peeled)\n1 Organic Beet (washed and peeled)\n2 Organic Red Apples (washed and cut)\n6 Organic Kale Leaves\n\u00bd Organic Lemon (washed and peeled)\n\u00bd inch Ginger Root\n\nOption 3: (Water/ACV Mixture) - If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through lunch, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n2:00pm - Mid-Afternoon Snack. This will be your last meal of the day. Choose one of the following 3 options:\nOption #1: Organic Avocados, Organic Lime or Lemon, & Himalayan Crystal Salt. Eat 2-3 organic avocados. Season with salt and fresh lime or lemon juice to taste. Avocados help the body produce glutathione, which is necessary for the liver to cleanse harmful toxins.\nOption #2: Eat 6-8 ounces of raw organic walnuts. Walnuts contain the amino acid arginine, which is necessary to help the liver detoxify ammonia. Walnuts are also high in glutathione and omega-3 fatty acids which support normal liver detoxification. Make sure you chew the nuts until they are liquefied before swallowing.\nOption #3: Water Meal. If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through the afternoon, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n7:00pm - USP Epsom Salt: Mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom Salt in 8 ounces of warm purified water. Drink it as fast as you can. It is advisable to be near a bathroom when drinking the Epsom Salt as some people experience liquid stools within 20-30 minutes after ingestion.\n8:30pm to 9:00pm: Drink The Olive Oil & Juice: Drink \u00be cup (6 ounces) of organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil. A small amount (2 tablespoons) of freshly squeezed orange, grapefruit, or lemon juice may be added to improve the taste.\nHow to Drink the Olive Oil: It's important to drink all 6 ounces of the olive oil; below are three approaches to help your experience:\nApproach #1: Thicken the oil by refrigeration for a few hours prior to ingestion to make it go down quickly.\nApproach #2: Thin the oil by using a jar to mix \u00bd cup of fresh grapefruit or orange juice into the oil and shake until thin.\r\n\tApproach #3: To reduce the taste and texture, gather two cups, straw, and small amount of juice. Place the olive oil in one cup, juice in the other, and use the straw to alternate drinking between the two.\r\n\tImmediately after drinking the oil, go to bed and lie on your right side with your knees drawn up to your stomach for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, you can stretch out and go to sleep. If you experience cramping, walk around for ten minutes or so and then go back to bed. You may also feel nauseated during the night. This is due to the release of stored toxins from the liver and gallbladder. This is normal and a sign the liver cleanse is working.\nIf you feel the need to vomit, do so as this will help release toxins. If you vomit, this is a sure sign your body is extremely toxic and you should consider repeating the liver cleanse after a five day break. Do not take Oxy-Powder on this night.\nCongratulations! You have just completed your first liver cleanse.What to Expect After the Liver Cleanse\nUpon waking in the morning, immediately take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder. This will help your intestinal tract and body flush the stones released from the liver and gallbladder during the night. For breakfast, eat only fruit. For lunch eat the remaining portion of your liver cleanse soup. For dinner eat a healthy meal such as a salad and some protein.\nIf you would like to see the stones, they should appear in your bowel movements for one to two days. We recommend putting a cheap colander over the toilet to collect the stones and then rinse the fecal matter off in the sink. You will be amazed at what comes out of you.\nRepeat the Liver Cleanse if Necessary\nIf you are still experiencing indications after your third flush, this may be a sign you need additional cleanses. The most we have heard of someone completing is 20 back-to-back liver cleanses before their indications were significantly reduced.\nFrequently Asked Questions:1) Can a liver cleanse be performed if the gallbladder has been removed?Yes!\r\n When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates \r\nfor its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver,\r\n will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some \r\npatients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other \r\ngastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery \r\nsymptoms whatsoever.\u00a0Keeping\r\n the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is\r\n vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are\r\n required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and\r\n the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it \r\neasier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong \r\nbut regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a\r\n liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the \r\nsame effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\u00a03) How will I know when my liver is clean?Everyone\u2019s\r\n results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as \r\nwell as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder \r\nare never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize \r\ntoxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people\r\n require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses\r\n once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is \r\nto judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will \r\nsimply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others \r\nmay take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and \r\nresolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment,\r\n emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to \r\nbe loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the \r\nOxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages \r\nof cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in \r\nfoul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a \r\ntimely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth,\r\n and slick in appearance.4) Will I experience a healing crisis?A\r\n healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during \r\ncleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse \r\nduring and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. \r\nThe accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from \r\nthe body. This process can include physical indications caused by these \r\ntoxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common \r\nindications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental \r\nclarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or \r\nsleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple \r\nindications while others have one or none. These indications will go \r\naway in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, \r\nmany people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense \r\nof well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I \r\nstrongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process \r\nand perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and\r\n drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along\r\n with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and \r\nfar-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\u00a05) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?You\r\n may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a \r\nliver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from \r\nthe Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, \r\nwe do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who \r\ncan assist you more directly with these accommodations.\n"}, {"itemid": "MPS-AP-BRZ-1", "subcat": "Alexapure Breeze", "name": "Alexapure Breeze", "img": ["alexapure-side.jpg", "alexapure-front.jpg", "alexapure-filters.jpg", "alexapure-filter-2.jpg"], "price": "$103.60", "desc": " <!--\r\n@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Raleway:400,500,700);\r\n@import url(http://code.ionicframework.com/ionicons/2.0.1/css/ionicons.min.css);\r\nfigure.snip1477 {\r\n  font-family: 'Raleway', Arial, sans-serif;\r\n  display: inline-block;\r\n  position: relative;\r\n  float: none;\r\n  overflow: hidden;\r\n  margin: 1px 1%;\r\n  min-width: 200px;\r\n  max-width: 220px;\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n  color: #ffffff;\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n  font-size: 16px;\r\n  background-color: #fff;\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477 *,\r\nfigure.snip1477 *:before,\r\nfigure.snip1477 *:after {\r\n  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;\r\n  box-sizing: border-box;\r\n  -webkit-transition: all 0.55s ease;\r\n  transition: all 0.55s ease;\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477 img {\r\n  max-width: 100%;\r\n  backface-visibility: hidden;\r\n  vertical-align: top;\r\n  opacity: 0.9;\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477 .title {\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  top: 58%;\r\n  left: 25px;\r\n  padding: 5px 10px 10px;\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477 .title:before,\r\nfigure.snip1477 .title:after {\r\n  height: 2px;\r\n  width: 400px;\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  content: '';\r\n  background-color: #ffffff;\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477 .title:before {\r\n  top: 0;\r\n  left: 10px;\r\n  -webkit-transform: translateX(100%);\r\n  transform: translateX(100%);\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477 .title:after {\r\n  bottom: 0;\r\n  right: 10px;\r\n  -webkit-transform: translateX(-100%);\r\n  transform: translateX(-100%);\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477 .title div:before,\r\nfigure.snip1477 .title div:after {\r\n  width: 2px;\r\n  height: 300px;\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  content: '';\r\n  background-color: #ffffff;\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477 .title div:before {\r\n  top: 10px;\r\n  right: 0;\r\n  -webkit-transform: translateY(100%);\r\n  transform: translateY(100%);\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477 .title div:after {\r\n  bottom: 10px;\r\n  left: 0;\r\n  -webkit-transform: translateY(-100%);\r\n  transform: translateY(-100%);\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477 h2,\r\nfigure.snip1477 h4 {\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n  text-transform: uppercase;\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477 h2 {\r\n  font-weight: 400;\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477 h4 {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  font-weight: 700;\r\n  background-color: #ffffff;\r\n  padding: 5px 10px;\r\n  color: #000000;\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477 figcaption {\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  bottom: 42%;\r\n  left: 25px;\r\n  text-align: left;\r\n  opacity: 0;\r\n  padding: 5px 60px 5px 10px;\r\n  font-size: 0.8em;\r\n  font-weight: 500;\r\n  letter-spacing: 1.5px;\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477 figcaption p {\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477 a {\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  top: 0;\r\n  bottom: 0;\r\n  left: 0;\r\n  right: 0;\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477:hover img,\r\nfigure.snip1477.hover img {\r\n  zoom: 1;\r\n  filter: alpha(opacity=35);\r\n  -webkit-opacity: 0.35;\r\n  opacity: 0.35;\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477:hover .title:before,\r\nfigure.snip1477.hover .title:before,\r\nfigure.snip1477:hover .title:after,\r\nfigure.snip1477.hover .title:after,\r\nfigure.snip1477:hover .title div:before,\r\nfigure.snip1477.hover .title div:before,\r\nfigure.snip1477:hover .title div:after,\r\nfigure.snip1477.hover .title div:after {\r\n  -webkit-transform: translate(0, 0);\r\n  transform: translate(0, 0);\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477:hover .title:before,\r\nfigure.snip1477.hover .title:before,\r\nfigure.snip1477:hover .title:after,\r\nfigure.snip1477.hover .title:after {\r\n  -webkit-transition-delay: 0.15s;\r\n  transition-delay: 0.15s;\r\n}\r\nfigure.snip1477:hover figcaption,\r\nfigure.snip1477.hover figcaption {\r\n  opacity: 1;\r\n  -webkit-transition-delay: 0.2s;\r\n  transition-delay: 0.2s;\r\n}\r\n-->\nInfowars Store is proud to introduce the revolutionary air purification system that can dramatically improve the air in your home.\nThe Breeze uses a four-stage purification process, including a true HEPA filter and our patented IonCluster technology.

When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates for its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver, will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some patients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other gastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery symptoms whatsoever.\u00a0\nKeeping the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\n\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\n\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it easier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong but regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the same effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3) How will I know when my liver is clean?\nEveryone\u2019s results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as well as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder are never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize toxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is to judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will simply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others may take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and resolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment, emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to be loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the Oxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages of cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in foul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a timely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth, and slick in appearance.\n\u00a0\n4) Will I experience a healing crisis?\nA healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during cleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. This process can include physical indications caused by these toxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common indications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental clarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or sleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple indications while others have one or none. These indications will go away in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, many people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense of well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I strongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process and perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and far-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\n\u00a0\n5) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?\nYou may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a liver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from the Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, we do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who can assist you more directly with these accommodations."}, {"itemid": "IWL-LIVDEF-1", "subcat": "Living Defense", "name": "Living Defense", "img": ["livingdefense_single2.jpg", "livingdefenselabelupdate.jpg"], "price": "$103.60", "desc": " Help Eliminate Toxic & Harmful Organisms From Your Body Living Defense\u2122 is a comprehensive blend of all-natural ingredients formulated to promote the cleansing and detoxification of harmful organisms.

Indications can vary from none, to mild discomfort, to serious disease.

The high tannin content of the green hull is primarily responsible for this effect. Other constituents such as juglandin, juglone, and juglandic acid are also involved in the purging process. Research suggests black walnut can oxygenate the blood to create a hostile environment to harmful organisms. The green husk also contains organic iodine, which assists the cleansing of harmful organisms.Organic Epazote (leaves, seed)Rich in ascaridole, epazote is an herb of choice for attacking and expelling various harmful organisms that take up residence in the intestinal tract.Wildcrafted Quassia (bark)The Quassia grows naturally throughout South America and has a particular interesting quality -- no bugs or insects ever bother it. The resin contains a compound known as quasi, which naturally repels insects.Organic Clove (bud)Clove Bud is considered one of the best herbs for killing eggs from harmful organisms and it also discourages fungus.Organic wormwood [Artemisia absinthium] (leaf/stem)Wormwood has been used as an intestinal cleansing herb as far back as 1600BC. Wormwood creates an extremely hostile environment for harmful organisms in your intestinal tract and promotes healthy digestion by increasing liver and gallbladder secretions.Veganzyme\u00ae Blend: (Protease with DPPIV, Amylase, Glucoamalyse, Lactase, Cellulase [I,II], Maltase, Hemicellulase, Xylanase, Beta Glucanase, Serrapeptase, Nattokinase, Bromelain, Papain, alpha Galactosidase, Lipase, Catalase, Invertase, Pectinase, Phytase, Glucose Oxidase)VeganZyme\u00ae is the most advanced, full-spectrum, systemic and digestive enzyme supplement available.

It's the Super Male you've been taking, with an extra punch. \n\nAlso Available: Super Female Vitality\n\nAfter reviewing the individual herbal components in the original Super Male Vitality, we decided we could enhance the potency by using higher concentrations of some herbs while lowering the concentrations of other herbs.\u00a0 We also advanced our extraction technology to stabilize more of the active plant compounds and essential oils without oxidation, in order to enhance the natural support and strength of Super Male Vitality by a considerable amount.The new Super Male Vitality also contains fulvic acid, which works to carry the individual components of the herbs deep into the body while also providing powerful benefits to the bioavailability of the finished extract. \nIntroducing Super Male Vitality\nAs men age, they may often experience a slow-down in vitality, energy, and overall wellness. Super Male Vitality is specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males, and has been used by Alex Jones in order to maximize vitality when working up to 12 hours a day or more in the fight for freedom. \n\"When I spoke to Dr. Edward Group about formulating a male vitality formula, I was excited about the idea of what it could do for me. Folks, let me tell you, this product works so well for me that I actually had to stop taking it before I go on air or else I would want to do hours and hours of overdrive with complete focus on the topics at hand.\nThere's no question that Super Male Vitality really works for me, and there's a reason that the entire process took more than 5 years to develop. Other products are priced way higher that claim to boost your vitality, yet they still may contain additives, fillers, you name it. The key with Super Male Vitality and all of the other products under Infowars Life has always been to never sacrifice on quality while still offering it at an even lower price than many of the products that are loaded with low quality ingredients. This is literally an infusion of the highest quality sources and naturally derived essences. I only bring the best formulations and products to my listeners, and Super Male Vitality has passed all of my expectations.\" - Alex Jones\nWhat are the Health Benefits of Super Male Vitality?\n\nSuper Male Vitality is designed to aid the body in ways that may help support normal testosterone levels in men.\nSuper Male Vitality features a unique formula that is completely free of GMOs (genetically modified ingredients), harmful additives, gluten, and is made right here in the USA.\nSuper Male Vitality is the only Spagyrex processed male vitality support product on the market.\nPromotes your body's own natural responses and does not use synthetic chemicals. \n\nThe Invention of Super Male Vitality\nSuper Male Vitality is the result of ancient wisdom reinterpreted over several years in the light of modern equipment and analysis.\nThe history of Super Male Vitality is based on the proprietary Spagyrex process, which was invented during extensive research on the numerous biological deficiencies that males may experience after they age.\nThis led researcher Dr. Group on a six year journey to create the most powerful herbal male hormonal support product on the market. It all started by studying a combination of herbs that have been traditionally understood to enhance and regulate the body as well as the works of the most famous 16th century healer, scientist and formulator,\u00a0Paracelsus.\nParacelsus originally composed the word Spagyria (Spagyry), which means to extract (spao) and combine (ageiro). The word was used to describe the process and power of turning a preparation of herbs into a liquid formula dedicated to enhancing health. \nThis original technology was taken and advanced by using the science of modern day technology.\nThe Spagyrex process used in Infowars Life products combines ancient and current technologies to create a revolutionary, multi-step, proprietary herbal formula technique that does not chemically change the natural ingredients. This follows the principle of separating and recombining all the elements of an herb, to extract the most powerful essence of its healing nature. \nSuper Male Vitality Ingredients:\nPlease note: while these Asian and South American herbs have been available individually in specialty herb shops in the United States for decades, we have brought them together in a unique combination for you.\nTribulus terrestris (fruit)\nTribulus terrestris is a vigorous plant integrated into the Super Male Vitality.\u00a0 Numerous benefits regarding vitality are attributed to the plant by men worldwide. \nSuma (root)\nSuma is a ground vine with deep roots. It is native to the Amazon and other parts of South America. Suma has been in use for nearly 300 years.

Raw elemental iodine is a controlled substance both at a State and Federal level. The licensing, approvals and regulatory documentary procedures are exacting and costly.Bound forms of iodine must first be separated, clarified and purified from other binding components or impurities into a USP-grade (United States Pharmaceutical), mono-elemental iodine as certified USP resublimated iodine crystals. In this purified crystal form, iodine is a highly reactive and toxic substance. However, when the purified USP iodine crystals are subjected to a proprietary process it becomes nano-colloidalized and transforms into a form of elemental nascent iodine, also referred to as monoatomic iodine, without the addition of iodides!Shocking Statistics About Iodine\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization's Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, iodine deficiency is a public health problem in 54 countries.\nThe CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world (Fortunately, it is the easiest to correct).\nThe 2013 USGS iodine commodity summary warns that there are no comparable substitutes for iodine.\nInformation published by UNICEF notes that iodine deficiency is the most avoidable cause of stunted physical and intellectual development.\n\nWhat Are The Health Benefits Of Nascent Iodine?\n\nProper iodine levels may provide support for normal response to environmental and dietary toxins.\nSupports thyroid health.\nMay support breast milk production and quality.\n\n Why Is Survival Shield X-2 The Best Nascent Iodine Available?\n\nSurvival Shield X-2 is created from salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface. \nIt is tested for radiation by our quality control experts before being placed for sale. \nIt is approximately 50% stronger than our original Survival Shield formulation. \nIt is a true glycerite of natural USP grade iodine\nThe nascent iodine in Survival Shield X-2 is not subjected to direct heat, harsh chemicals, or alcohol.\nThe transformative process produces a stable product that no other brand can match!\nCompletely non-GMO certified.\nVegan-friendly and completely non-toxic.\nIt provides high elemental iodine uptake.\nContains NO inefficient iodides.\nDoes not sting or burn.\n\nIMPORTANT SHIPPING INFORMATION:\u00a0International Customers, please check with your country's customs office regarding the import of the products.\u00a0 As the buyer, you are solely responsible for any import restrictions, prohibited import items, taxes, tariffs, fees and other duties.\nSurvival Shield X-2 now ships from a separate warehouse via USPS.
