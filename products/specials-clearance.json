His parents are told to make funeral arrangements.  However, his father had  read about a version of an ancient drug made  from cannabis.

Try to incorporate the following dietary guidelines to reduce your toxin exposure while cleansing.\n\nTry to purchase organic or locally grown foods as conventional foods are often over-processed, sprayed with pesticides, or grown in nutrient depleted soil.\nTry to include healthy oils in your diet such as coconut, hemp, flax seed, or olive.\nAvoid cow's milk and cheese during the cleanse, instead try almond or hemp milk.\nAvoid foods that contain gluten, such as cereal grains, wheat, barley, white flour, pasta, bread, couscous, flour, tortillas, cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, chips, imitation fish, hot dogs, and fried foods.\nAvoid alcoholic beverages.\nAvoid diet sodas and other products often contain artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame, neotame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Substitute with natural sweeteners such as honey, stevia, or coconut sugar.\nAvoid foods that contain high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, molasses, white sugar, dextrose, sorbitol, processed fructose, and sucrose.\nReplace table salt (sodium chloride) with himalayan salt.\nAvoid soy products. Most soy contains pesticide residue and is genetically modified. Soybeans are also high in phytic acid which is damaging to the digestive tract and blocks the absorption of nutrients and essential minerals.\nCaffeine, in moderation, is acceptable during your cleanse. Try organic tea or coffee without creamers and use natural sweeteners such as raw honey.\n\nWhat To Expect During Your Liver Cleanse\nOxy-Powder can cause watery stools, so make sure a bathroom is nearby. If your stools are liquid, remember this is not diarrhea but the result of turning solid compacted fecal matter in the intestinal tract into a liquid or gas.\nA small percentage of people may experience what is known as a healing crisis. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. Don't get discouraged.\nBefore You Start: Prepare Your Liver Cleanse Formula\nThe night before you start your cleanse, make the following 2 gallons and try to go to bed before 9pm to get a good night's rest.\nHow to Make the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula\n\nMaking Gallon #1: Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula: Pour out 3 ounces from your 1st gallon of distilled or purified water and add all of the Liver Shield formula and 2 tablespoons of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). Shake and refrigerate.\nMaking Gallon #2: Water/Apple Cider Vinegar Mixture (ACV): Pour out 2 ounces from your 2nd gallon of distilled or purified drinking water and add 1 ounce of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar. Shake and refrigerate.\n\nDay 1 - Start Your Liver Cleanse\n\n8:00am: Eat a healthy Breakfast Option (see breakfast diet options from day 1-4). Do not mix the fruits!\n9:00am: Drink one 8-ounce glass of Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n10:00-11:00am: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n12:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n1:00pm: Eat healthy Lunch Meal (see lunch diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your lunch meal.\n3:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n4:00-5:00pm: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n6:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n7:00pm: Eat healthy Dinner Meal (see dinner diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your dinner meal.\n8:00-10:00pm: Before bed, take 4 capsules of Oxy-Powder. Do not go to bed past 10pm!\n\nDays Two, Three, and Four of Your Liver Cleanse\nFollow the same instructions as Day 1, however, from 8:00-10:00pm: take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder.\nDay 5 of Your Liver Cleanse - Flush Day\u009d\n8:00am to 10:00am - Breakfast Meal (see breakfast diet options for day 5). Do not mix the fruits! We recommend using watermelon if it is available due to its high glutathione content.\nAfter breakfast, start preparing your Liver Cleanse Soup for lunch (see the recipe below) if you choose Option #1. Drink the Water/ACV Mixture as needed until lunch.\n12:00pm - Liver Supporting Lunch Meal. Choose from one of the following 3 options for your lunch meal:\nOption #1 - Liver Cleanse Soup (Recommended)\nTo maximize the liver's ability to detox and cleanse, choose a combination of foods which are high in naturally occurring sulphur and glutathione. Sulphur helps the liver cleanse harmful chemicals.\nThe ingredients in the liver cleanse soup include the following:\n\n1 Organic Beet (Washed and Chopped)\n2 Organic Carrots (Chopped)\n1 Cup Broccoli (Chopped)\n10 Organic Garlic Cloves (Minced)\n\u00bd Organic Onion (Chopped)\n\u00bc Organic Lemon\n2 Bay Leaves\n1 Teaspoon Himalayan Crystal Salt\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Turmeric\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Oregano\nOther liver cleansing foods you can use:artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, kale, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower can be added to the soup.\n\nTo prepare the Liver Cleanse Soup: Wash vegetables. Finely chop ingredients to desired consistency. Pour 32 ounces of distilled or purified water into a soup pot. Add all of the ingredients to the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and then simmer on low heat for one hour. Eat this soup for your lunch meal. After your meal, refrigerate the remaining portion of your soup for tomorrow's lunch meal (Day 6).\nOption #2 - Beet/Carrot Juice (Alternate):\n\nPeel and juice ingredients in a blender until desired consistency is achieved.\n3 Organic Carrots (washed and peeled)\n1 Organic Beet (washed and peeled)\n2 Organic Red Apples (washed and cut)\n6 Organic Kale Leaves\n\u00bd Organic Lemon (washed and peeled)\n\u00bd inch Ginger Root\n\nOption 3: (Water/ACV Mixture) - If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through lunch, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n2:00pm - Mid-Afternoon Snack. This will be your last meal of the day. Choose one of the following 3 options:\nOption #1: Organic Avocados, Organic Lime or Lemon, & Himalayan Crystal Salt. Eat 2-3 organic avocados. Season with salt and fresh lime or lemon juice to taste. Avocados help the body produce glutathione, which is necessary for the liver to cleanse harmful toxins.\nOption #2: Eat 6-8 ounces of raw organic walnuts. Walnuts contain the amino acid arginine, which is necessary to help the liver detoxify ammonia. Walnuts are also high in glutathione and omega-3 fatty acids which support normal liver detoxification. Make sure you chew the nuts until they are liquefied before swallowing.\nOption #3: Water Meal. If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through the afternoon, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n7:00pm - USP Epsom Salt: Mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom Salt in 8 ounces of warm purified water. Drink it as fast as you can. It is advisable to be near a bathroom when drinking the Epsom Salt as some people experience liquid stools within 20-30 minutes after ingestion.\n8:30pm to 9:00pm: Drink The Olive Oil & Juice: Drink \u00be cup (6 ounces) of organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil. A small amount (2 tablespoons) of freshly squeezed orange, grapefruit, or lemon juice may be added to improve the taste.\nHow to Drink the Olive Oil: It's important to drink all 6 ounces of the olive oil; below are three approaches to help your experience:\nApproach #1: Thicken the oil by refrigeration for a few hours prior to ingestion to make it go down quickly.\nApproach #2: Thin the oil by using a jar to mix \u00bd cup of fresh grapefruit or orange juice into the oil and shake until thin.\r\n\tApproach #3: To reduce the taste and texture, gather two cups, straw, and small amount of juice. Place the olive oil in one cup, juice in the other, and use the straw to alternate drinking between the two.\r\n\tImmediately after drinking the oil, go to bed and lie on your right side with your knees drawn up to your stomach for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, you can stretch out and go to sleep. If you experience cramping, walk around for ten minutes or so and then go back to bed. You may also feel nauseated during the night. This is due to the release of stored toxins from the liver and gallbladder. This is normal and a sign the liver cleanse is working.\nIf you feel the need to vomit, do so as this will help release toxins. If you vomit, this is a sure sign your body is extremely toxic and you should consider repeating the liver cleanse after a five day break. Do not take Oxy-Powder on this night.\nCongratulations! You have just completed your first liver cleanse.What to Expect After the Liver Cleanse\nUpon waking in the morning, immediately take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder. This will help your intestinal tract and body flush the stones released from the liver and gallbladder during the night. For breakfast, eat only fruit. For lunch eat the remaining portion of your liver cleanse soup. For dinner eat a healthy meal such as a salad and some protein.\nIf you would like to see the stones, they should appear in your bowel movements for one to two days. We recommend putting a cheap colander over the toilet to collect the stones and then rinse the fecal matter off in the sink. You will be amazed at what comes out of you.\nRepeat the Liver Cleanse if Necessary\nIf you are still experiencing indications after your third flush, this may be a sign you need additional cleanses. The most we have heard of someone completing is 20 back-to-back liver cleanses before their indications were significantly reduced.\nFrequently Asked Questions:1) Can a liver cleanse be performed if the gallbladder has been removed?Yes!\r\n When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates \r\nfor its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver,\r\n will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some \r\npatients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other \r\ngastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery \r\nsymptoms whatsoever.\u00a0Keeping\r\n the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is\r\n vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are\r\n required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and\r\n the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it \r\neasier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong \r\nbut regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a\r\n liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the \r\nsame effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\u00a03) How will I know when my liver is clean?Everyone\u2019s\r\n results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as \r\nwell as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder \r\nare never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize \r\ntoxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people\r\n require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses\r\n once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is \r\nto judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will \r\nsimply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others \r\nmay take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and \r\nresolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment,\r\n emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to \r\nbe loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the \r\nOxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages \r\nof cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in \r\nfoul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a \r\ntimely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth,\r\n and slick in appearance.4) Will I experience a healing crisis?A\r\n healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during \r\ncleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse \r\nduring and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. \r\nThe accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from \r\nthe body. This process can include physical indications caused by these \r\ntoxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common \r\nindications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental \r\nclarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or \r\nsleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple \r\nindications while others have one or none. These indications will go \r\naway in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, \r\nmany people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense \r\nof well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I \r\nstrongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process \r\nand perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and\r\n drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along\r\n with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and \r\nfar-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\u00a05) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?You\r\n may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a \r\nliver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from \r\nthe Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, \r\nwe do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who \r\ncan assist you more directly with these accommodations.\n"}, {"itemid": "AC-BCRW-1", "subcat": "Current Specials", "name": "Bill Clinton RAPE Whistle", "img": ["rapewhistle_2.png", "rape-whistle-11_1.jpg"], "price": "$103.60", "desc": "    Start the conversation and get the attention of everyone in the room.

Selenium even plays a role in the natural function of reproductive health, DNA production, and eyesight.\nAs a powerful antioxidant, selenium helps fight free radicals and may even be considered a super antioxidant' because of the way in which it may support other antioxidants.\nOne of its most valuable roles is supporting the natural production of glutathione peroxidase, a key antioxidant enzyme that supports the thyroid and even helps recycle vitamin E and vitamin C into active scavengers of free radicals.\nInfowars Life\u2019s high-potency Bio-True Selenium capsules are made from 100% certified organic mustard seeds and each serving delivers 200 mcg of food-derived, vegan-friendly selenium.\nThe Top 5 Reasons You Need Selenium\n1. A Powerful Antioxidant\nSelenium is an antioxidant that fights free radicals that damage cells and may lead to premature aging. Selenium\u2019s antioxidant status also helps support the immune system naturally.\n2. Healthy Thyroid Support\nMuch like iodine, selenium is important for normal thyroid function. Selenium is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones, and a selenium deficiency can negatively affect healthy hormone balance and normal thyroid function.\n3. Supports Cardiovascular Health\nSelenium plays a notable role in supporting normal cardiovascular health. Selenium can benefit heart health by soothing oxidative stress and supporting normal circulation.\n4.

How much selenium is enough? The recommended dietary allowance of selenium for adults can range from 55-200mcg. Adult females may need as little as 55 mcg; adult males as little as 70 mcg; pregnant females at least 65 mcg; and 75 mcg/day for lactating females. For adults, the safe upper limit is 400 mcg/day.\n2. Why is consistent consumption of selenium important? Selenium is a trace mineral and we only need a small amount of it. However, because it plays a role in many important functions, it may get used quickly. A selenium supplement can help ensure regular and consistent availability of this important nutrient.\n3. Why is mustard seed used? Mustard seeds are an excellent, vegan-friendly source of selenium and other nutrients.

The problem was, however, that in order to get the quality and potency they wanted, they had to go out and purchase 2, 3, or even 4 different products at a time.\nAnd even then, there were issues with quality, the number of strains in the product, and of course a question of whether or not they were supporting the right companies with their purchases.\nThat's what prompted Dr. Group to begin a seven-year journey to develop the most advanced, all-in-one, full-spectrum, digestive and intestinal health probiotic formula out there*****. \nThis wasn't easy, and it took years to even start sourcing the right ingredients for the groundbreaking formula that would eventually come to be known as Biome Defense\u2122 by Infowars Life. One challenge was finding super high quality probiotics created from trustworthy sources. The other challenge was to find a probiotic company that would agree to use our non-toxic, non-GMO certified organic gum acacia, which in itself works as a prebiotic; an innovation that was a world's first in the industry. \nThe world's leading probiotic manufacturers were shocked that Dr. Group refused to settle for cheap probiotic strains with bigger margins. But instead of buckling to industry heads, we are now proud to offer Biome Defense\u2122: a complete prebiotic and probiotic formulation with over 50 billion live and active cultures from 23 probiotic strains. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Top 5 Reasons You Need Biome Defense\n1. Digestive Support\nProbiotics are friendly organisms that help assist the digestive process and encourage proper nutrient absorption. Your digestive tract is a complex 'machine' that converts nutrients into energy, and supporting your digestive tract is one of the most effective measures you can take to encourage your health.\n\u00a0\n2. Helps Boost the Immune System\nYour gut makes up a very large portion of your immune system, so it should come as no surprise that it is important to start supporting your gut health in order to help boost your immune system.\u00a0 Supporting healthy intestinal epithelium lining integrity, which is the front line for the immune system, is essential for optimal health.\n\u00a0\n3. Promotes Internal Balance\nYour gut is home to over 500 types of bacteria -- some of them are good, some of them are bad. A daily probiotic supplement like Biome Defense\u2122\u00a0 helps promote the growth of good bacteria to help 'balance out' the bad. Biome Defense\u2122 can be a key part of your all natural solutions for replenishing your gut's supply of good bacteria and keeping harmful organisms at bay.\n4.

Each capsule contains 50 billion live active CFUs of 23 popular and rare strains of bacteria you won't find anywhere else.\nIn addition to these strains, Biome Defense\u2122 also offers the added bonus of fulvic acid to help supercharge the comprehensive formula.\n5.

What are prebiotics?\u00a0Prebiotics are carbohydrate fibers called 'oligosaccharides' that you don't digest; they essentially act as food for probiotics. They remain in your digestive system to help boost the growth of beneficial bacteria. Sources of prebiotics include fruits, raw honey, and legumes.\n2. What factors negatively affect intestinal flora?\u00a0The gut is a delicate environment that's susceptible to imbalance and can be significantly affected by what you put into your body. Friendly gut bacteria or gut bacteria balance may be negatively impacted by things such as certain unhealthy nutrition choices, prescription medications, and other factors.\n3. What does CFU mean?\u00a0Colony forming units are how probiotics are measured, generally measured in the millions or billions per serving. We test to assure that Biome Defense\u2122 meets potency specifications at the time of manufacture.\n\u00a0\nTips for a Healthy Gut\n\n\u00b7Eat prebiotic rich foods like fruits, raw honey, and legumes.\n\u00b7Stay well hydrated with purified water.\n\u00b7Exercise regularly.\n\u00b7Meditate or practice breathing exercises to help minimize the effects of stress.\n\u00b7Follow a clean, organic diet. Avoid artificial ingredients, refined sugars, and processed foods.\n\u00b7Fermented foods are a great source of friendly probiotics and typically loaded with beneficial vitamins and nutrients.\n\n\u00a0\nStart supporting healthy digestion with\u00a0 50 billion live and active cultures from 23 different probiotic strains.

When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates for its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver, will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some patients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other gastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery symptoms whatsoever.\u00a0\nKeeping the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\n\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\n\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it easier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong but regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the same effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3) How will I know when my liver is clean?\nEveryone\u2019s results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as well as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder are never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize toxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is to judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will simply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others may take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and resolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment, emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to be loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the Oxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages of cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in foul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a timely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth, and slick in appearance.\n\u00a0\n4) Will I experience a healing crisis?\nA healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during cleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. This process can include physical indications caused by these toxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common indications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental clarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or sleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple indications while others have one or none. These indications will go away in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, many people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense of well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I strongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process and perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and far-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\n\u00a0\n5) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?\nYou may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a liver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from the Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, we do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who can assist you more directly with these accommodations."}, {"itemid": "IWL-LIVDEF-1", "subcat": "Current Specials", "name": "Living Defense", "img": ["livingdefense_single2.jpg", "livingdefenselabelupdate.jpg"], "price": "$44.95", "desc": " Help Eliminate Toxic & Harmful Organisms From Your Body Living Defense\u2122 is a comprehensive blend of all-natural ingredients formulated to promote the cleansing and detoxification of harmful organisms.

This need prompted our journey to create the most powerful, vegan, vitamin D3 product on the market.We located an extremely pure and powerful source of D3, extracted from lichen, and pioneered research to combine it with USP vegetable glycerin to provide 2000IU of D3 per 10 drops.This research and development took over two years but the result, as verified by independent laboratories like Stirling University, is the best, vegan, vitamin D3 product in the world.\"\nWhat are the Health Benefits of Vitamin D?\n\n--Promotes calcium absorption for healthy bones and teeth.\n--Supports the body's natural immune system.\n--Supports natural muscle strength in older adults.\n--Adequate vitamin D is necessary for healthy tissue in systems of the body including the pancreas, breasts, colon, and prostate.\n\nWhy is Winter Sun the Best Vitamin D3 Supplement Available?\n\n--Formulated for easy absorption.\n--Appropriate for vegetarians and vegans.\n--Does not contain any toxins, excipients, or toxic additives.\n--GMO-free.\n"}, {"itemid": "SP-IWL-X2SELEN-1", "subcat": "Current Specials", "name": "X-2 Bio True Selenium Combo", "img": ["selenium-x2-thumbnail.png", "selenium-6-29-16_1.jpg", "x2_label_3.jpg"], "price": "$64.90", "desc": " About Bio-True Selenium\nWhat is Selenium?\nSelenium is an essential trace mineral that supports a healthy thyroid gland, supports the immune system, is essential for metabolic pathways, and much more. Selenium even plays a role in the natural function of reproductive health, DNA production, and eyesight.\nAs a powerful antioxidant, selenium helps fight free radicals and may even be considered a super antioxidant' because of the way in which it may support other antioxidants.\nOne of its most valuable roles is supporting the natural production of glutathione peroxidase, a key antioxidant enzyme that supports the thyroid and even helps recycle vitamin E and vitamin C into active scavengers of free radicals.\nInfowars Life\u2019s high-potency Bio-True Selenium capsules are made from 100% certified organic mustard seeds and each serving delivers 200 mcg of food-derived, vegan-friendly selenium.\nThe Top 5 Reasons You Need Selenium\n1. A Powerful Antioxidant\nSelenium is an antioxidant that fights free radicals that damage cells and may lead to premature aging. Selenium\u2019s antioxidant status also helps support the immune system naturally.\n2. Healthy Thyroid Support\nMuch like iodine, selenium is important for normal thyroid function. Selenium is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones, and a selenium deficiency can negatively affect healthy hormone balance and normal thyroid function.\n3. Supports Cardiovascular Health\nSelenium plays a notable role in supporting normal cardiovascular health. Selenium can benefit heart health by soothing oxidative stress and supporting normal circulation.\n4. Food-Sourced Formula\nUnlike many selenium formulas out there, Infowars Life Bio-True Selenium\u2122 is never synthetic. It\u2019s a whole food form of selenium extracted from 100% certified organic mustard seed. Each high-potency capsule delivers 200 mcg of highly bioavailable, organically sourced selenium.\n5. Unparalleled Quality\nInfowars Life\u2019s high-potency selenium formula is produced in the USA at a state of the art manufacturing facility equipped with all modern equipment that adheres to cGMP guidelines and has achieved ISO 22000 certification -- the highest in food safety.\nInteresting Facts About Selenium\n\nSelenium concentrations decline with age.\nSelenium is more concentrated in the thyroid than any other area of the body.\nFoods reputed to be good sources of selenium include Brazil Nuts, brewer's yeast, wheat germ, garlic, grains, sunflower seeds, walnuts, raisins, and seafood.\nSoil levels of selenium can vary dramatically from one region to the next.\n\nThe Health Benefits of Selenium\n\nSelenium is one of the body's primary antioxidant enzymes\nSupports normal thyroid and immune function in healthy individuals.\nEncourages normal oxygen levels in the heart.\nSupports healthy bones and joints.\nRequired for the production of prostaglandins that promote healthy blood flow.\nIn synergy with vitamin E, selenium supports energy producing cells.\n\nThe Top 3 Questions People Ask About Selenium\n1. How much selenium is enough? The recommended dietary allowance of selenium for adults can range from 55-200mcg. Adult females may need as little as 55 mcg; adult males as little as 70 mcg; pregnant females at least 65 mcg; and 75 mcg/day for lactating females. For adults, the safe upper limit is 400 mcg/day.\n2. Why is consistent consumption of selenium important? Selenium is a trace mineral and we only need a small amount of it. However, because it plays a role in many important functions, it may get used quickly. A selenium supplement can help ensure regular and consistent availability of this important nutrient.\n3. Why is mustard seed used? Mustard seeds are an excellent, vegan-friendly source of selenium and other nutrients. In fact, Infowars Life\u2019s Bio-True Selenium\u2122 extract even offers cofactors and co-nutrients from the mustard seeds that help the activity of the selenium.\nABOUT SURVIVAL SHIELD X-2\nLeading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine, the new Infowars Life Survival Shield X-2 is now here.\u00a0New Stronger Formula From 7,000 Feet Below The SurfaceDerived from 200 million year old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface, the next level of Survival Shield is now here and much stronger than our original formula with a powerful 650 micrograms per single drop.Experience the benefits of next level proprietary nascent iodine, developed using our\u00a0Thermodynamic Pressure Sensitive High Energy Sound Pulse Nano-Emulsion Technology\u00a0that allows for a highly unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives and genetically modified ingredients.\u00a0 We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X-2 iodine for radiation during our quality control phase.\nThe Top 5 Reasons You Need Nascent Iodine\u00a0\n\nIodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health and well-being.\u00a0\u00a0\nNascent iodine may support healthy iodine levels.\u00a0\u00a0\nNascent iodine may support healthy hormone levels.\u00a0\u00a0\nNascent iodine may be involved in maintaining healthy metabolism.\nSupplementing with pure nascent iodine may provide sufficient iodine so that the body does not need to absorb iodine from other, perhaps less pure, sources.\n\nSurvival Shield X-2 QualitySurvival Shield X-2 is manufactured in a state-licensed facility that meets federal regulatory standards, is cGMP/HACCP-compliant, and lab grade. Raw elemental iodine is a controlled substance both at a State and Federal level. The licensing, approvals and regulatory documentary procedures are exacting and costly.Bound forms of iodine must first be separated, clarified and purified from other binding components or impurities into a USP-grade (United States Pharmaceutical), mono-elemental iodine as certified USP resublimated iodine crystals. In this purified crystal form, iodine is a highly reactive and toxic substance. However, when the purified USP iodine crystals are subjected to a proprietary process it becomes nano-colloidalized and transforms into a form of elemental nascent iodine, also referred to as monoatomic iodine, without the addition of iodides!Shocking Statistics About Iodine\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization's Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, iodine deficiency is a public health problem in 54 countries.\nThe CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world (Fortunately, it is the easiest to correct).\nThe 2013 USGS iodine commodity summary warns that there are no comparable substitutes for iodine.\nInformation published by UNICEF notes that iodine deficiency is the most avoidable cause of stunted physical and intellectual development.\n\nWhat Are The Health Benefits Of Nascent Iodine?\n\nProper iodine levels may provide support for normal response to environmental and dietary toxins.\nSupports thyroid health.\nMay support breast milk production and quality.\n\nWhy Is Survival Shield X-2 The Best Nascent Iodine Available?\n\nSurvival Shield X-2 is created from salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.\u00a0\nIt is tested for radiation by our quality control experts before being placed for sale.\u00a0\nIt is approximately 50% stronger than our original Survival Shield formulation.\u00a0\nIt is a true glycerite of natural USP grade iodine\nThe nascent iodine in Survival Shield X-2 is not subjected to direct heat, harsh chemicals, or alcohol.\nThe transformative process produces a stable product that no other brand can match!\nCompletely non-GMO certified.\nVegan-friendly and completely non-toxic.\nIt provides high elemental iodine uptake.\nContains NO inefficient iodides.\nDoes not sting or burn.\n\nIMPORTANT SHIPPING INFORMATION:\u00a0International Customers, please check with your country's customs office regarding the import of the products.\u00a0\u00a0As the buyer, you are solely responsible for any import restrictions, prohibited import items, taxes, tariffs, fees and other duties.\u00a0These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.\u00a0\u00a0This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. \u00a0Testimonials represent a cross section of the range of results that appear to be typical with these products.

Try to incorporate the following dietary guidelines to reduce your toxin exposure while cleansing.\n\nTry to purchase organic or locally grown foods as conventional foods are often over-processed, sprayed with pesticides, or grown in nutrient depleted soil.\nTry to include healthy oils in your diet such as coconut, hemp, flax seed, or olive.\nAvoid cow's milk and cheese during the cleanse, instead try almond or hemp milk.\nAvoid foods that contain gluten, such as cereal grains, wheat, barley, white flour, pasta, bread, couscous, flour, tortillas, cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, chips, imitation fish, hot dogs, and fried foods.\nAvoid alcoholic beverages.\nAvoid diet sodas and other products often contain artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame, neotame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Substitute with natural sweeteners such as honey, stevia, or coconut sugar.\nAvoid foods that contain high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, molasses, white sugar, dextrose, sorbitol, processed fructose, and sucrose.\nReplace table salt (sodium chloride) with himalayan salt.\nAvoid soy products. Most soy contains pesticide residue and is genetically modified. Soybeans are also high in phytic acid which is damaging to the digestive tract and blocks the absorption of nutrients and essential minerals.\nCaffeine, in moderation, is acceptable during your cleanse. Try organic tea or coffee without creamers and use natural sweeteners such as raw honey.\n\nWhat To Expect During Your Liver Cleanse\nOxy-Powder can cause watery stools, so make sure a bathroom is nearby. If your stools are liquid, remember this is not diarrhea but the result of turning solid compacted fecal matter in the intestinal tract into a liquid or gas.\nA small percentage of people may experience what is known as a healing crisis. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. Don't get discouraged.\nBefore You Start: Prepare Your Liver Cleanse Formula\nThe night before you start your cleanse, make the following 2 gallons and try to go to bed before 9pm to get a good night's rest.\nHow to Make the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula\n\nMaking Gallon #1: Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula: Pour out 3 ounces from your 1st gallon of distilled or purified water and add all of the Liver Shield formula and 2 tablespoons of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). Shake and refrigerate.\nMaking Gallon #2: Water/Apple Cider Vinegar Mixture (ACV): Pour out 2 ounces from your 2nd gallon of distilled or purified drinking water and add 1 ounce of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar. Shake and refrigerate.\n\nDay 1 - Start Your Liver Cleanse\n\n8:00am: Eat a healthy Breakfast Option (see breakfast diet options from day 1-4). Do not mix the fruits!\n9:00am: Drink one 8-ounce glass of Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n10:00-11:00am: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n12:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n1:00pm: Eat healthy Lunch Meal (see lunch diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your lunch meal.\n3:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n4:00-5:00pm: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n6:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n7:00pm: Eat healthy Dinner Meal (see dinner diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your dinner meal.\n8:00-10:00pm: Before bed, take 4 capsules of Oxy-Powder. Do not go to bed past 10pm!\n\nDays Two, Three, and Four of Your Liver Cleanse\nFollow the same instructions as Day 1, however, from 8:00-10:00pm: take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder.\nDay 5 of Your Liver Cleanse - Flush Day\u009d\n8:00am to 10:00am - Breakfast Meal (see breakfast diet options for day 5). Do not mix the fruits! We recommend using watermelon if it is available due to its high glutathione content.\nAfter breakfast, start preparing your Liver Cleanse Soup for lunch (see the recipe below) if you choose Option #1. Drink the Water/ACV Mixture as needed until lunch.\n12:00pm - Liver Supporting Lunch Meal. Choose from one of the following 3 options for your lunch meal:\nOption #1 - Liver Cleanse Soup (Recommended)\nTo maximize the liver's ability to detox and cleanse, choose a combination of foods which are high in naturally occurring sulphur and glutathione. Sulphur helps the liver cleanse harmful chemicals.\nThe ingredients in the liver cleanse soup include the following:\n\n1 Organic Beet (Washed and Chopped)\n2 Organic Carrots (Chopped)\n1 Cup Broccoli (Chopped)\n10 Organic Garlic Cloves (Minced)\n\u00bd Organic Onion (Chopped)\n\u00bc Organic Lemon\n2 Bay Leaves\n1 Teaspoon Himalayan Crystal Salt\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Turmeric\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Oregano\nOther liver cleansing foods you can use:artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, kale, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower can be added to the soup.\n\nTo prepare the Liver Cleanse Soup: Wash vegetables. Finely chop ingredients to desired consistency. Pour 32 ounces of distilled or purified water into a soup pot. Add all of the ingredients to the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and then simmer on low heat for one hour. Eat this soup for your lunch meal. After your meal, refrigerate the remaining portion of your soup for tomorrow's lunch meal (Day 6).\nOption #2 - Beet/Carrot Juice (Alternate):\n\nPeel and juice ingredients in a blender until desired consistency is achieved.\n3 Organic Carrots (washed and peeled)\n1 Organic Beet (washed and peeled)\n2 Organic Red Apples (washed and cut)\n6 Organic Kale Leaves\n\u00bd Organic Lemon (washed and peeled)\n\u00bd inch Ginger Root\n\nOption 3: (Water/ACV Mixture) - If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through lunch, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n2:00pm - Mid-Afternoon Snack. This will be your last meal of the day. Choose one of the following 3 options:\nOption #1: Organic Avocados, Organic Lime or Lemon, & Himalayan Crystal Salt. Eat 2-3 organic avocados. Season with salt and fresh lime or lemon juice to taste. Avocados help the body produce glutathione, which is necessary for the liver to cleanse harmful toxins.\nOption #2: Eat 6-8 ounces of raw organic walnuts. Walnuts contain the amino acid arginine, which is necessary to help the liver detoxify ammonia. Walnuts are also high in glutathione and omega-3 fatty acids which support normal liver detoxification. Make sure you chew the nuts until they are liquefied before swallowing.\nOption #3: Water Meal. If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through the afternoon, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n7:00pm - USP Epsom Salt: Mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom Salt in 8 ounces of warm purified water. Drink it as fast as you can. It is advisable to be near a bathroom when drinking the Epsom Salt as some people experience liquid stools within 20-30 minutes after ingestion.\n8:30pm to 9:00pm: Drink The Olive Oil & Juice: Drink \u00be cup (6 ounces) of organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil. A small amount (2 tablespoons) of freshly squeezed orange, grapefruit, or lemon juice may be added to improve the taste.\nHow to Drink the Olive Oil: It's important to drink all 6 ounces of the olive oil; below are three approaches to help your experience:\nApproach #1: Thicken the oil by refrigeration for a few hours prior to ingestion to make it go down quickly.\nApproach #2: Thin the oil by using a jar to mix \u00bd cup of fresh grapefruit or orange juice into the oil and shake until thin.\r\n\tApproach #3: To reduce the taste and texture, gather two cups, straw, and small amount of juice. Place the olive oil in one cup, juice in the other, and use the straw to alternate drinking between the two.\r\n\tImmediately after drinking the oil, go to bed and lie on your right side with your knees drawn up to your stomach for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, you can stretch out and go to sleep. If you experience cramping, walk around for ten minutes or so and then go back to bed. You may also feel nauseated during the night. This is due to the release of stored toxins from the liver and gallbladder. This is normal and a sign the liver cleanse is working.\nIf you feel the need to vomit, do so as this will help release toxins. If you vomit, this is a sure sign your body is extremely toxic and you should consider repeating the liver cleanse after a five day break. Do not take Oxy-Powder on this night.\nCongratulations! You have just completed your first liver cleanse.What to Expect After the Liver Cleanse\nUpon waking in the morning, immediately take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder. This will help your intestinal tract and body flush the stones released from the liver and gallbladder during the night. For breakfast, eat only fruit. For lunch eat the remaining portion of your liver cleanse soup. For dinner eat a healthy meal such as a salad and some protein.\nIf you would like to see the stones, they should appear in your bowel movements for one to two days. We recommend putting a cheap colander over the toilet to collect the stones and then rinse the fecal matter off in the sink. You will be amazed at what comes out of you.\nRepeat the Liver Cleanse if Necessary\nIf you are still experiencing indications after your third flush, this may be a sign you need additional cleanses. The most we have heard of someone completing is 20 back-to-back liver cleanses before their indications were significantly reduced.\nFrequently Asked Questions:1) Can a liver cleanse be performed if the gallbladder has been removed?Yes!\r\n When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates \r\nfor its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver,\r\n will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some \r\npatients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other \r\ngastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery \r\nsymptoms whatsoever.\u00a0Keeping\r\n the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is\r\n vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are\r\n required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and\r\n the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it \r\neasier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong \r\nbut regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a\r\n liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the \r\nsame effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\u00a03) How will I know when my liver is clean?Everyone\u2019s\r\n results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as \r\nwell as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder \r\nare never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize \r\ntoxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people\r\n require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses\r\n once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is \r\nto judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will \r\nsimply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others \r\nmay take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and \r\nresolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment,\r\n emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to \r\nbe loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the \r\nOxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages \r\nof cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in \r\nfoul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a \r\ntimely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth,\r\n and slick in appearance.4) Will I experience a healing crisis?A\r\n healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during \r\ncleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse \r\nduring and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. \r\nThe accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from \r\nthe body. This process can include physical indications caused by these \r\ntoxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common \r\nindications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental \r\nclarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or \r\nsleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple \r\nindications while others have one or none. These indications will go \r\naway in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, \r\nmany people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense \r\nof well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I \r\nstrongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process \r\nand perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and\r\n drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along\r\n with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and \r\nfar-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\u00a05) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?You\r\n may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a \r\nliver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from \r\nthe Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, \r\nwe do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who \r\ncan assist you more directly with these accommodations.\n"}, {"itemid": "EE-BUGSPRAY-NB-1", "subcat": "Health & Wellness Specials", "name": "Herbal Bug Spray - Emric's Essentials", "img": ["b-away_bug_spray-thumbnail.png", "bug_spray_label.png"], "price": "$19.95", "desc": " B-Away Spray (Made with Organic)\nSize: 4 ounce\nAll-Natural, Made from Organic Ingredients, Herbal Outdoor Spray\nA DEET-Free Spray with Aromatherapy Oils to Help Protect Your Skin\n\nNo N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET)\nMade from organic ingredients\nAlcohol and mineral oil free\nNo petroleum based ingredients\nNo parabens or preservatives\nNo synthetic additives or scents\nVegetarian, vegan and non-GMO\nFree from artificial colors or preservatives\nFree from yeast, gluten, dairy, soy and corn\nBPA-Free 4oz Bottle\n\nBest Way to Dodge Those Pesky Bugs\nYou probably like to spend most of your summer outdoors and unfortunately having to share your space with bugs is inevitable.

During this time we've found that so many 'staple' formulations have not yet been advanced with new leaps in nutraceutical science. We asked, why is everyone else developing processed, synthetic forms of vitamin B-12 that are loaded with fillers?Low quality B-12 formulations can have serious problems when it comes to their affect on the body, their purity, and of course what's known as their 'bio-active' abilities. That's why many are having to resort to painful B-12 injections, which require needles and may come with a lot of pain. What is the Infowars Life Secret 12 B Vitamin Formula?Although most of us simply know vitamin B-12 as the B vitamin responsible for energy production, it's important to understand that vitamin B-12 is actually a catch-all term for a class of vitamins known as cobalamins -- cyanocobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, methycobalamin, and adenosylcobalamin -- and they are not equal in their benefits. Whereas traditional B-12 supplements contain cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalmin, Infowars Life Secret 12 contains methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalmin, specifically chosen from all other forms for their bioactive characteristics. The Top 5 Reasons You Need Infowars Life Secret 121.\u00a0 Encourages Normal Energy LevelsVitamin B-12 promotes energy production in multiple ways. It helps to support the body's natural processes of the adrenal glands, red blood cell formation, and may help convert carbohydrates to glucose -- the fuel your body uses for energy.2.\u00a0 You Want the Purest, Most Advanced B Vitamin BlendMethylcobalamin, or methylated B-12 is the select coenzyme form of B-12 used in Secret 12, and when paired with adenosylcobalamin, the other coenzyme form of B-12, forms the key blend that makes Secret 12 so special.3. Help The Body Fight B-12 DeficiencyB-12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.4. Supports Your Body's Major ProcessesAs defense against homocysteine, B-12 is nutritional support for numerous essential bodily functions. 5. You Know What You're GettingAs always with Infowars Life, when you try Secret 12, you know you are securing the highest quality formulation that has been created using proprietary technology housed within a GMP certified laboratory inside the United States. And you're supporting an organization that you believe in. Shocking Facts About Vitamin B-12As many as 30% of adults over 50 are unable to absorb B-12 in foodVitamin B-12 deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia, a fatigue ridden condition where red blood cells don't develop properly and can't carry oxygen efficiently.B-12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.Why Infowars Life Secret 12 Is Your Best Choice For Vitamin BContains methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, the bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B-12.The European Food Safety Authority reports that the combination of adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin is the best and safest representation of naturally occurring vitamin B-12.Secret 12 B-12 is an easy and delicious liquid formula -- no injections.Made in the USA and according to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).Energize Your Mind and Body Today With Infowars Life Secret 12 "}, {"itemid": "IWL-SLVRBULLET-1", "subcat": "Health & Wellness Specials", "name": "Silver Bullet -- Colloidal Silver", "img": ["silverbullet65percentoff.jpg", "silverbullet_label2_aug2015.jpg"], "price": "$29.95", "desc": " Infowars Life Silver Bullet Colloidal SilverThe Infowars Life Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver is finally here following Alex's extensive search for a powerful colloidal silver product that is both free of artificial additives and utilizes high quality processes to ensure for a truly unique product that has applications for both preparedness and regular use.

This is literally an infusion of the highest quality sources and naturally derived essences. I only bring the best formulations and products to my listeners, and Super Male Vitality has passed all of my expectations.\" - Alex Jones\nWhat are the Health Benefits of Super Male Vitality?\n\nSuper Male Vitality is designed to aid the body in ways that may help support normal testosterone levels in men.\nSuper Male Vitality features a unique formula that is completely free of GMOs (genetically modified ingredients), harmful additives, gluten, and is made right here in the USA.\nSuper Male Vitality is the only Spagyrex processed male vitality support product on the market.\nPromotes your body's own natural responses and does not use synthetic chemicals. \n\nThe Invention of Super Male Vitality\nSuper Male Vitality is the result of ancient wisdom reinterpreted over several years in the light of modern equipment and analysis.\nThe history of Super Male Vitality is based on the proprietary Spagyrex process, which was invented during extensive research on the numerous biological deficiencies that males may experience after they age.\nThis led researcher Dr. Group on a six year journey to create the most powerful herbal male hormonal support product on the market. It all started by studying a combination of herbs that have been traditionally understood to enhance and regulate the body as well as the works of the most famous 16th century healer, scientist and formulator,\u00a0Paracelsus.\nParacelsus originally composed the word Spagyria (Spagyry), which means to extract (spao) and combine (ageiro). The word was used to describe the process and power of turning a preparation of herbs into a liquid formula dedicated to enhancing health. \nThis original technology was taken and advanced by using the science of modern day technology.\nThe Spagyrex process used in Infowars Life products combines ancient and current technologies to create a revolutionary, multi-step, proprietary herbal formula technique that does not chemically change the natural ingredients. This follows the principle of separating and recombining all the elements of an herb, to extract the most powerful essence of its healing nature. \nSuper Male Vitality Ingredients:\nPlease note: while these Asian and South American herbs have been available individually in specialty herb shops in the United States for decades, we have brought them together in a unique combination for you.\nTribulus terrestris (fruit)\nTribulus terrestris is a vigorous plant integrated into the Super Male Vitality.\u00a0 Numerous benefits regarding vitality are attributed to the plant by men worldwide. \nSuma (root)\nSuma is a ground vine with deep roots. It is native to the Amazon and other parts of South America. Suma has been in use for nearly 300 years. It's even been called \"the Russian Secret\" due to its use by Russian athletes.\nAshwaganda (root)\nBetter known as Indian ginseng, ashwaganda has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine as a key ingredient that may help to enhance energy and mental function.\nMaca (root)\nMaca, or Peruvian ginseng, is a vigorous plant that grows atop the Andes. Maca was made popular by indigenous tribes in Peru who have used the root for purposes of vitality for quite some time.\nAvena sativa (root)\nAlso known as the common oat, avena sativa contains natural compounds that may help support normal response in men.\nTongkat ali (root)\nTongkat ali, or Malaysian ginseng, is traditionally held to support a number of natural functions in men.\nCatuaba (bark)\nNative to the Amazon, catuaba is a small, flowering tree. Its bark was discovered by the Tupi tribe and described as having qualities that may aid in male vitality. \nMuira puama (bark)\nMuira puama is a small tree native to the Amazon. Practitioners of Brazilian herbal medicine reportedly use muira puama bark.\nFulvic acid\n\u00a0\nAdditional Tips for Vitality\nReduce the stress in your life.

Try to incorporate the following dietary guidelines to reduce your toxin exposure while cleansing.\n\nTry to purchase organic or locally grown foods as conventional foods are often over-processed, sprayed with pesticides, or grown in nutrient depleted soil.\nTry to include healthy oils in your diet such as coconut, hemp, flax seed, or olive.\nAvoid cow's milk and cheese during the cleanse, instead try almond or hemp milk.\nAvoid foods that contain gluten, such as cereal grains, wheat, barley, white flour, pasta, bread, couscous, flour, tortillas, cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, chips, imitation fish, hot dogs, and fried foods.\nAvoid alcoholic beverages.\nAvoid diet sodas and other products often contain artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame, neotame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Substitute with natural sweeteners such as honey, stevia, or coconut sugar.\nAvoid foods that contain high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, molasses, white sugar, dextrose, sorbitol, processed fructose, and sucrose.\nReplace table salt (sodium chloride) with himalayan salt.\nAvoid soy products. Most soy contains pesticide residue and is genetically modified. Soybeans are also high in phytic acid which is damaging to the digestive tract and blocks the absorption of nutrients and essential minerals.\nCaffeine, in moderation, is acceptable during your cleanse. Try organic tea or coffee without creamers and use natural sweeteners such as raw honey.\n\nWhat To Expect During Your Liver Cleanse\nOxy-Powder can cause watery stools, so make sure a bathroom is nearby. If your stools are liquid, remember this is not diarrhea but the result of turning solid compacted fecal matter in the intestinal tract into a liquid or gas.\nA small percentage of people may experience what is known as a healing crisis. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. Don't get discouraged.\nBefore You Start: Prepare Your Liver Cleanse Formula\nThe night before you start your cleanse, make the following 2 gallons and try to go to bed before 9pm to get a good night's rest.\nHow to Make the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula\n\nMaking Gallon #1: Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula: Pour out 3 ounces from your 1st gallon of distilled or purified water and add all of the Liver Shield formula and 2 tablespoons of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). Shake and refrigerate.\nMaking Gallon #2: Water/Apple Cider Vinegar Mixture (ACV): Pour out 2 ounces from your 2nd gallon of distilled or purified drinking water and add 1 ounce of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar. Shake and refrigerate.\n\nDay 1 - Start Your Liver Cleanse\n\n8:00am: Eat a healthy Breakfast Option (see breakfast diet options from day 1-4). Do not mix the fruits!\n9:00am: Drink one 8-ounce glass of Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n10:00-11:00am: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n12:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n1:00pm: Eat healthy Lunch Meal (see lunch diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your lunch meal.\n3:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n4:00-5:00pm: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n6:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n7:00pm: Eat healthy Dinner Meal (see dinner diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your dinner meal.\n8:00-10:00pm: Before bed, take 4 capsules of Oxy-Powder. Do not go to bed past 10pm!\n\nDays Two, Three, and Four of Your Liver Cleanse\nFollow the same instructions as Day 1, however, from 8:00-10:00pm: take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder.\nDay 5 of Your Liver Cleanse - Flush Day\u009d\n8:00am to 10:00am - Breakfast Meal (see breakfast diet options for day 5). Do not mix the fruits! We recommend using watermelon if it is available due to its high glutathione content.\nAfter breakfast, start preparing your Liver Cleanse Soup for lunch (see the recipe below) if you choose Option #1. Drink the Water/ACV Mixture as needed until lunch.\n12:00pm - Liver Supporting Lunch Meal. Choose from one of the following 3 options for your lunch meal:\nOption #1 - Liver Cleanse Soup (Recommended)\nTo maximize the liver's ability to detox and cleanse, choose a combination of foods which are high in naturally occurring sulphur and glutathione. Sulphur helps the liver cleanse harmful chemicals.\nThe ingredients in the liver cleanse soup include the following:\n\n1 Organic Beet (Washed and Chopped)\n2 Organic Carrots (Chopped)\n1 Cup Broccoli (Chopped)\n10 Organic Garlic Cloves (Minced)\n\u00bd Organic Onion (Chopped)\n\u00bc Organic Lemon\n2 Bay Leaves\n1 Teaspoon Himalayan Crystal Salt\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Turmeric\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Oregano\nOther liver cleansing foods you can use:artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, kale, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower can be added to the soup.\n\nTo prepare the Liver Cleanse Soup: Wash vegetables. Finely chop ingredients to desired consistency. Pour 32 ounces of distilled or purified water into a soup pot. Add all of the ingredients to the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and then simmer on low heat for one hour. Eat this soup for your lunch meal. After your meal, refrigerate the remaining portion of your soup for tomorrow's lunch meal (Day 6).\nOption #2 - Beet/Carrot Juice (Alternate):\n\nPeel and juice ingredients in a blender until desired consistency is achieved.\n3 Organic Carrots (washed and peeled)\n1 Organic Beet (washed and peeled)\n2 Organic Red Apples (washed and cut)\n6 Organic Kale Leaves\n\u00bd Organic Lemon (washed and peeled)\n\u00bd inch Ginger Root\n\nOption 3: (Water/ACV Mixture) - If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through lunch, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n2:00pm - Mid-Afternoon Snack. This will be your last meal of the day. Choose one of the following 3 options:\nOption #1: Organic Avocados, Organic Lime or Lemon, & Himalayan Crystal Salt. Eat 2-3 organic avocados. Season with salt and fresh lime or lemon juice to taste. Avocados help the body produce glutathione, which is necessary for the liver to cleanse harmful toxins.\nOption #2: Eat 6-8 ounces of raw organic walnuts. Walnuts contain the amino acid arginine, which is necessary to help the liver detoxify ammonia. Walnuts are also high in glutathione and omega-3 fatty acids which support normal liver detoxification. Make sure you chew the nuts until they are liquefied before swallowing.\nOption #3: Water Meal. If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through the afternoon, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n7:00pm - USP Epsom Salt: Mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom Salt in 8 ounces of warm purified water. Drink it as fast as you can. It is advisable to be near a bathroom when drinking the Epsom Salt as some people experience liquid stools within 20-30 minutes after ingestion.\n8:30pm to 9:00pm: Drink The Olive Oil & Juice: Drink \u00be cup (6 ounces) of organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil. A small amount (2 tablespoons) of freshly squeezed orange, grapefruit, or lemon juice may be added to improve the taste.\nHow to Drink the Olive Oil: It's important to drink all 6 ounces of the olive oil; below are three approaches to help your experience:\nApproach #1: Thicken the oil by refrigeration for a few hours prior to ingestion to make it go down quickly.\nApproach #2: Thin the oil by using a jar to mix \u00bd cup of fresh grapefruit or orange juice into the oil and shake until thin.\r\n\tApproach #3: To reduce the taste and texture, gather two cups, straw, and small amount of juice. Place the olive oil in one cup, juice in the other, and use the straw to alternate drinking between the two.\r\n\tImmediately after drinking the oil, go to bed and lie on your right side with your knees drawn up to your stomach for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, you can stretch out and go to sleep. If you experience cramping, walk around for ten minutes or so and then go back to bed. You may also feel nauseated during the night. This is due to the release of stored toxins from the liver and gallbladder. This is normal and a sign the liver cleanse is working.\nIf you feel the need to vomit, do so as this will help release toxins. If you vomit, this is a sure sign your body is extremely toxic and you should consider repeating the liver cleanse after a five day break. Do not take Oxy-Powder on this night.\nCongratulations! You have just completed your first liver cleanse.What to Expect After the Liver Cleanse\nUpon waking in the morning, immediately take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder. This will help your intestinal tract and body flush the stones released from the liver and gallbladder during the night. For breakfast, eat only fruit. For lunch eat the remaining portion of your liver cleanse soup. For dinner eat a healthy meal such as a salad and some protein.\nIf you would like to see the stones, they should appear in your bowel movements for one to two days. We recommend putting a cheap colander over the toilet to collect the stones and then rinse the fecal matter off in the sink. You will be amazed at what comes out of you.\nRepeat the Liver Cleanse if Necessary\nIf you are still experiencing indications after your third flush, this may be a sign you need additional cleanses. The most we have heard of someone completing is 20 back-to-back liver cleanses before their indications were significantly reduced.\nFrequently Asked Questions:1) Can a liver cleanse be performed if the gallbladder has been removed?Yes!\r\n When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates \r\nfor its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver,\r\n will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some \r\npatients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other \r\ngastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery \r\nsymptoms whatsoever.\u00a0Keeping\r\n the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is\r\n vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are\r\n required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and\r\n the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it \r\neasier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong \r\nbut regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a\r\n liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the \r\nsame effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\u00a03) How will I know when my liver is clean?Everyone\u2019s\r\n results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as \r\nwell as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder \r\nare never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize \r\ntoxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people\r\n require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses\r\n once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is \r\nto judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will \r\nsimply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others \r\nmay take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and \r\nresolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment,\r\n emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to \r\nbe loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the \r\nOxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages \r\nof cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in \r\nfoul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a \r\ntimely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth,\r\n and slick in appearance.4) Will I experience a healing crisis?A\r\n healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during \r\ncleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse \r\nduring and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. \r\nThe accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from \r\nthe body. This process can include physical indications caused by these \r\ntoxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common \r\nindications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental \r\nclarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or \r\nsleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple \r\nindications while others have one or none. These indications will go \r\naway in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, \r\nmany people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense \r\nof well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I \r\nstrongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process \r\nand perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and\r\n drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along\r\n with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and \r\nfar-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\u00a05) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?You\r\n may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a \r\nliver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from \r\nthe Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, \r\nwe do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who \r\ncan assist you more directly with these accommodations.\n"}, {"itemid": "IWL-ANPLX-1", "subcat": "Infowars Life Specials", "name": "Anthroplex", "img": ["anthroplex-tumbnail.jpg", "anthroplex-label.jpg"], "price": "$39.95", "desc": " Introducing Anthroplex, the twice daily pill foundation for men that contains key compounds like horny goat weed, zinc orotate, and a newly balanced blend of hand-selected organic herbs.\n\u00a0\nWhat You've Been Asking For: Anthroplex Is Finally Here\nFor years, listeners have been asking us to add certain ingredients like horny goat weed and zinc orotate to the Super Male Vitality formula, but the years of research and testing put into the precisely balanced Super Male Vitality formula have proven that the exact ratios of the cold pressed organic herbs are essential to maintain.\nThat's why Anthroplex works synergistically with the powerful Super Male Vitality formula in order to help restore your masculine foundation and stimulate vitality with its own blend of unique ingredients.\n\u00a0\nAnthroplex's Unique Formula & Ingredients\n\u00a0\nZinc Orotate\nZinc is an essential dietary mineral that's necessary for proper healthy immune system function, the normal breakdown of food and nutrients, and a number of other processes within the body pertaining to vitality.\n\u00a0\nHorny Goat Weed - Epimedium\nHorny goat weed, or epimedium, is an herb that has been used for ages in Chinese medicine for vitality, and has also been noted for its antioxidant activity.\n\u00a0\nTribulus Terrestris\nTribulus Terrestris has been used in Ayurvedic practice as an herb of choice for vitality, and is noted to contain a compound called protodioscin, which is the putative active component of the herb.\n\u00a0\nTongKat Ali\nAlso known as Malaysian ginseng, TongKat Ali has been traditionally held to support a number of natural functions in men, and was specifically added to the Anthroplex formula using a very specific ingredient ratio.\n\u00a0\nNow Is The Time...\nNow is the time to start fighting back and rebuilding your foundation.

In fact, it is essential to have a good balance of friendly bacteria in the gut for optimum health. Labeled by many as the 'good bacteria' in your gut, probiotics are living microorganisms that live in your digestive tract and support good digestive health.\nBiome Defense by Infowars Life is a probiotic and prebiotic supplement that helps populate your digestive tract with a mix of beneficial bacteria to support digestion and boost the immune system.\nMany people consider a daily probiotic to be as important to their health as a multi-vitamin, and for good reason: a healthy body requires a healthy gut!\nThe 7-Year Creation Story of Biome Defense\u2122\nFor years, Alex and Dr. Edward Group have used and recommended multiple different probiotic formulas to help replenish good bacteria in the gut. The problem was, however, that in order to get the quality and potency they wanted, they had to go out and purchase 2, 3, or even 4 different products at a time.\nAnd even then, there were issues with quality, the number of strains in the product, and of course a question of whether or not they were supporting the right companies with their purchases.\nThat's what prompted Dr. Group to begin a seven-year journey to develop the most advanced, all-in-one, full-spectrum, digestive and intestinal health probiotic formula out there*****. \nThis wasn't easy, and it took years to even start sourcing the right ingredients for the groundbreaking formula that would eventually come to be known as Biome Defense\u2122 by Infowars Life. One challenge was finding super high quality probiotics created from trustworthy sources. The other challenge was to find a probiotic company that would agree to use our non-toxic, non-GMO certified organic gum acacia, which in itself works as a prebiotic; an innovation that was a world's first in the industry. \nThe world's leading probiotic manufacturers were shocked that Dr. Group refused to settle for cheap probiotic strains with bigger margins. But instead of buckling to industry heads, we are now proud to offer Biome Defense\u2122: a complete prebiotic and probiotic formulation with over 50 billion live and active cultures from 23 probiotic strains. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Top 5 Reasons You Need Biome Defense\n1. Digestive Support\nProbiotics are friendly organisms that help assist the digestive process and encourage proper nutrient absorption. Your digestive tract is a complex 'machine' that converts nutrients into energy, and supporting your digestive tract is one of the most effective measures you can take to encourage your health.\n\u00a0\n2. Helps Boost the Immune System\nYour gut makes up a very large portion of your immune system, so it should come as no surprise that it is important to start supporting your gut health in order to help boost your immune system.\u00a0 Supporting healthy intestinal epithelium lining integrity, which is the front line for the immune system, is essential for optimal health.\n\u00a0\n3. Promotes Internal Balance\nYour gut is home to over 500 types of bacteria -- some of them are good, some of them are bad. A daily probiotic supplement like Biome Defense\u2122\u00a0 helps promote the growth of good bacteria to help 'balance out' the bad. Biome Defense\u2122 can be a key part of your all natural solutions for replenishing your gut's supply of good bacteria and keeping harmful organisms at bay.\n4.

Each capsule contains 50 billion live active CFUs of 23 popular and rare strains of bacteria you won't find anywhere else.\nIn addition to these strains, Biome Defense\u2122 also offers the added bonus of fulvic acid to help supercharge the comprehensive formula.\n5.

When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates for its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver, will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some patients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other gastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery symptoms whatsoever.\u00a0\nKeeping the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\n\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\n\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it easier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong but regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the same effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3) How will I know when my liver is clean?\nEveryone\u2019s results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as well as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder are never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize toxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is to judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will simply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others may take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and resolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment, emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to be loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the Oxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages of cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in foul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a timely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth, and slick in appearance.\n\u00a0\n4) Will I experience a healing crisis?\nA healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during cleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. This process can include physical indications caused by these toxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common indications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental clarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or sleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple indications while others have one or none. These indications will go away in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, many people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense of well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I strongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process and perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and far-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\n\u00a0\n5) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?\nYou may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a liver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from the Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, we do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who can assist you more directly with these accommodations."}, {"itemid": "SP-IWL-LIVSHD-2PK", "subcat": "Infowars Life Specials", "name": "Liver Shield: 2 Pack", "img": ["livershield_2pak.jpg", "livershield_label_2.jpg"], "price": "$103.60", "desc": " \n<!--\r\np.important-info a {\r\nfont-size: 34pt;\r\ntext-decoration: underline;\r\n}\r\n-->\nIs your liver toxic?  \nClick here for the Advanced Liver Cleanse\n  With all of the toxic additives in the food supply, the pharmaceutical drugs in the water, and of course the consumption of alcohol, the answer may be a resounding \u201cYES!\u201d \nThe all-new Infowars Life Liver Shield\u2122\u00a0is a 100% all natural blend of powerful organic and wildcrafted herbs specifically formulated to support natural function and detoxification of the liver and gallbladder.\nThe liver is responsible for over 500 separate functions in the body, and is known to be your primary 'filter' within the body. \nFollowing prolonged toxic buildup, your liver can become full of fatty deposits, built up toxins, and even\u00a0 dangerous objects known as 'liver stones'.

The most common indications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental clarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or sleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple indications while others have one or none. These indications will go away in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, many people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense of well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I strongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process and perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and far-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\n\u00a0\n5) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?\nYou may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a liver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from the Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, we do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who can assist you more directly with these accommodations."}, {"itemid": "IWL-LIVDEF-1", "subcat": "Infowars Life Specials", "name": "Living Defense", "img": ["livingdefense_single2.jpg", "livingdefenselabelupdate.jpg"], "price": "$44.95", "desc": " Help Eliminate Toxic & Harmful Organisms From Your Body Living Defense\u2122 is a comprehensive blend of all-natural ingredients formulated to promote the cleansing and detoxification of harmful organisms.

It all started by studying a combination of herbs that have been traditionally understood to enhance and regulate the body as well as the works of the most famous 16th century healer, scientist and formulator,\u00a0Paracelsus.\nParacelsus originally composed the word Spagyria (Spagyry), which means to extract (spao) and combine (ageiro).

Maca was made popular by indigenous tribes in Peru who have used the root for purposes of vitality for quite some time.\nAvena sativa (root)\nAlso known as the common oat, avena sativa contains natural compounds that may help support normal response in men.\nTongkat ali (root)\nTongkat ali, or Malaysian ginseng, is traditionally held to support a number of natural functions in men.\nCatuaba (bark)\nNative to the Amazon, catuaba is a small, flowering tree.

Selenium even plays a role in the natural function of reproductive health, DNA production, and eyesight.\nAs a powerful antioxidant, selenium helps fight free radicals and may even be considered a super antioxidant' because of the way in which it may support other antioxidants.\nOne of its most valuable roles is supporting the natural production of glutathione peroxidase, a key antioxidant enzyme that supports the thyroid and even helps recycle vitamin E and vitamin C into active scavengers of free radicals.\nInfowars Life\u2019s high-potency Bio-True Selenium capsules are made from 100% certified organic mustard seeds and each serving delivers 200 mcg of food-derived, vegan-friendly selenium.\nThe Top 5 Reasons You Need Selenium\n1. A Powerful Antioxidant\nSelenium is an antioxidant that fights free radicals that damage cells and may lead to premature aging. Selenium\u2019s antioxidant status also helps support the immune system naturally.\n2. Healthy Thyroid Support\nMuch like iodine, selenium is important for normal thyroid function. Selenium is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones, and a selenium deficiency can negatively affect healthy hormone balance and normal thyroid function.\n3. Supports Cardiovascular Health\nSelenium plays a notable role in supporting normal cardiovascular health. Selenium can benefit heart health by soothing oxidative stress and supporting normal circulation.\n4. Food-Sourced Formula\nUnlike many selenium formulas out there, Infowars Life Bio-True Selenium\u2122 is never synthetic. It\u2019s a whole food form of selenium extracted from 100% certified organic mustard seed. Each high-potency capsule delivers 200 mcg of highly bioavailable, organically sourced selenium.\n5. Unparalleled Quality\nInfowars Life\u2019s high-potency selenium formula is produced in the USA at a state of the art manufacturing facility equipped with all modern equipment that adheres to cGMP guidelines and has achieved ISO 22000 certification -- the highest in food safety.\nInteresting Facts About Selenium\n\nSelenium concentrations decline with age.\nSelenium is more concentrated in the thyroid than any other area of the body.\nFoods reputed to be good sources of selenium include Brazil Nuts, brewer's yeast, wheat germ, garlic, grains, sunflower seeds, walnuts, raisins, and seafood.\nSoil levels of selenium can vary dramatically from one region to the next.\n\nThe Health Benefits of Selenium\n\nSelenium is one of the body's primary antioxidant enzymes\nSupports normal thyroid and immune function in healthy individuals.\nEncourages normal oxygen levels in the heart.\nSupports healthy bones and joints.\nRequired for the production of prostaglandins that promote healthy blood flow.\nIn synergy with vitamin E, selenium supports energy producing cells.\n\nThe Top 3 Questions People Ask About Selenium\n1. How much selenium is enough? The recommended dietary allowance of selenium for adults can range from 55-200mcg. Adult females may need as little as 55 mcg; adult males as little as 70 mcg; pregnant females at least 65 mcg; and 75 mcg/day for lactating females. For adults, the safe upper limit is 400 mcg/day.\n2. Why is consistent consumption of selenium important? Selenium is a trace mineral and we only need a small amount of it. However, because it plays a role in many important functions, it may get used quickly. A selenium supplement can help ensure regular and consistent availability of this important nutrient.\n3. Why is mustard seed used? Mustard seeds are an excellent, vegan-friendly source of selenium and other nutrients. In fact, Infowars Life\u2019s Bio-True Selenium\u2122 extract even offers cofactors and co-nutrients from the mustard seeds that help the activity of the selenium.\nABOUT SURVIVAL SHIELD X-2\nLeading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine, the new Infowars Life Survival Shield X-2 is now here.\u00a0New Stronger Formula From 7,000 Feet Below The SurfaceDerived from 200 million year old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface, the next level of Survival Shield is now here and much stronger than our original formula with a powerful 650 micrograms per single drop.Experience the benefits of next level proprietary nascent iodine, developed using our\u00a0Thermodynamic Pressure Sensitive High Energy Sound Pulse Nano-Emulsion Technology\u00a0that allows for a highly unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives and genetically modified ingredients.\u00a0 We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X-2 iodine for radiation during our quality control phase.\nThe Top 5 Reasons You Need Nascent Iodine\u00a0\n\nIodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health and well-being.\u00a0\u00a0\nNascent iodine may support healthy iodine levels.\u00a0\u00a0\nNascent iodine may support healthy hormone levels.\u00a0\u00a0\nNascent iodine may be involved in maintaining healthy metabolism.\nSupplementing with pure nascent iodine may provide sufficient iodine so that the body does not need to absorb iodine from other, perhaps less pure, sources.\n\nSurvival Shield X-2 QualitySurvival Shield X-2 is manufactured in a state-licensed facility that meets federal regulatory standards, is cGMP/HACCP-compliant, and lab grade. Raw elemental iodine is a controlled substance both at a State and Federal level. The licensing, approvals and regulatory documentary procedures are exacting and costly.Bound forms of iodine must first be separated, clarified and purified from other binding components or impurities into a USP-grade (United States Pharmaceutical), mono-elemental iodine as certified USP resublimated iodine crystals. In this purified crystal form, iodine is a highly reactive and toxic substance. However, when the purified USP iodine crystals are subjected to a proprietary process it becomes nano-colloidalized and transforms into a form of elemental nascent iodine, also referred to as monoatomic iodine, without the addition of iodides!Shocking Statistics About Iodine\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization's Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, iodine deficiency is a public health problem in 54 countries.\nThe CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world (Fortunately, it is the easiest to correct).\nThe 2013 USGS iodine commodity summary warns that there are no comparable substitutes for iodine.\nInformation published by UNICEF notes that iodine deficiency is the most avoidable cause of stunted physical and intellectual development.\n\nWhat Are The Health Benefits Of Nascent Iodine?\n\nProper iodine levels may provide support for normal response to environmental and dietary toxins.\nSupports thyroid health.\nMay support breast milk production and quality.\n\nWhy Is Survival Shield X-2 The Best Nascent Iodine Available?\n\nSurvival Shield X-2 is created from salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.\u00a0\nIt is tested for radiation by our quality control experts before being placed for sale.\u00a0\nIt is approximately 50% stronger than our original Survival Shield formulation.\u00a0\nIt is a true glycerite of natural USP grade iodine\nThe nascent iodine in Survival Shield X-2 is not subjected to direct heat, harsh chemicals, or alcohol.\nThe transformative process produces a stable product that no other brand can match!\nCompletely non-GMO certified.\nVegan-friendly and completely non-toxic.\nIt provides high elemental iodine uptake.\nContains NO inefficient iodides.\nDoes not sting or burn.\n\nIMPORTANT SHIPPING INFORMATION:\u00a0International Customers, please check with your country's customs office regarding the import of the products.\u00a0\u00a0As the buyer, you are solely responsible for any import restrictions, prohibited import items, taxes, tariffs, fees and other duties.\u00a0These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.\u00a0\u00a0This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. \u00a0Testimonials represent a cross section of the range of results that appear to be typical with these products.

Stone also reveals how and why the mainstream media got it wrong, including how the polls were loaded and completely misunderstood who would vote.\nStone, a long time Trump retainer and confidant, gives us the inside story of how Donald Trump almost single-handedly harnessed discontent among \u201cForgotten Americans\u201d despite running a guerrilla-style grass roots campaign to compete with the smooth running and free-spending Clinton political machine.\nStone's analysis is akin to Theodore H. White\u2019s seminal book The Making of the President 1960. It is both a sweeping analysis of the trends that elected Trump as well as the war stories of a hard-bitten political survivor who Donald Trump called \u201cone tough cookie.\"\nAbout The Author\nHost of the Stone Cold Truth show, Roger Stone is a seasoned political operative and pundit. A veteran of nine national presidential campaigns, he served as a senior campaign aide to three Republican presidents.

During this time we've found that so many 'staple' formulations have not yet been advanced with new leaps in nutraceutical science. We asked, why is everyone else developing processed, synthetic forms of vitamin B-12 that are loaded with fillers?Low quality B-12 formulations can have serious problems when it comes to their affect on the body, their purity, and of course what's known as their 'bio-active' abilities. That's why many are having to resort to painful B-12 injections, which require needles and may come with a lot of pain. What is the Infowars Life Secret 12 B Vitamin Formula?Although most of us simply know vitamin B-12 as the B vitamin responsible for energy production, it's important to understand that vitamin B-12 is actually a catch-all term for a class of vitamins known as cobalamins -- cyanocobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, methycobalamin, and adenosylcobalamin -- and they are not equal in their benefits. Whereas traditional B-12 supplements contain cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalmin, Infowars Life Secret 12 contains methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalmin, specifically chosen from all other forms for their bioactive characteristics. The Top 5 Reasons You Need Infowars Life Secret 121.\u00a0 Encourages Normal Energy LevelsVitamin B-12 promotes energy production in multiple ways. It helps to support the body's natural processes of the adrenal glands, red blood cell formation, and may help convert carbohydrates to glucose -- the fuel your body uses for energy.2.\u00a0 You Want the Purest, Most Advanced B Vitamin BlendMethylcobalamin, or methylated B-12 is the select coenzyme form of B-12 used in Secret 12, and when paired with adenosylcobalamin, the other coenzyme form of B-12, forms the key blend that makes Secret 12 so special.3. Help The Body Fight B-12 DeficiencyB-12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.4. Supports Your Body's Major ProcessesAs defense against homocysteine, B-12 is nutritional support for numerous essential bodily functions. 5. You Know What You're GettingAs always with Infowars Life, when you try Secret 12, you know you are securing the highest quality formulation that has been created using proprietary technology housed within a GMP certified laboratory inside the United States. And you're supporting an organization that you believe in. Shocking Facts About Vitamin B-12As many as 30% of adults over 50 are unable to absorb B-12 in foodVitamin B-12 deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia, a fatigue ridden condition where red blood cells don't develop properly and can't carry oxygen efficiently.B-12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.Why Infowars Life Secret 12 Is Your Best Choice For Vitamin BContains methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, the bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B-12.The European Food Safety Authority reports that the combination of adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin is the best and safest representation of naturally occurring vitamin B-12.Secret 12 B-12 is an easy and delicious liquid formula -- no injections.Made in the USA and according to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).Energize Your Mind and Body Today With Infowars Life Secret 12 "}, {"itemid": "IWL-SLVRBULLET-1", "subcat": "Silver Bullet -- Colloidal Silver", "name": "Silver Bullet -- Colloidal Silver", "img": ["silverbullet65percentoff.jpg", "silverbullet_label2_aug2015.jpg"], "price": "$29.95", "desc": " Infowars Life Silver Bullet Colloidal SilverThe Infowars Life Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver is finally here following Alex's extensive search for a powerful colloidal silver product that is both free of artificial additives and utilizes high quality processes to ensure for a truly unique product that has applications for both preparedness and regular use.

Super Male Vitality is specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males, and has been used by Alex Jones in order to maximize vitality when working up to 12 hours a day or more in the fight for freedom. \n\"When I spoke to Dr. Edward Group about formulating a male vitality formula, I was excited about the idea of what it could do for me. Folks, let me tell you, this product works so well for me that I actually had to stop taking it before I go on air or else I would want to do hours and hours of overdrive with complete focus on the topics at hand.\nThere's no question that Super Male Vitality really works for me, and there's a reason that the entire process took more than 5 years to develop. Other products are priced way higher that claim to boost your vitality, yet they still may contain additives, fillers, you name it. The key with Super Male Vitality and all of the other products under Infowars Life has always been to never sacrifice on quality while still offering it at an even lower price than many of the products that are loaded with low quality ingredients. This is literally an infusion of the highest quality sources and naturally derived essences. I only bring the best formulations and products to my listeners, and Super Male Vitality has passed all of my expectations.\" - Alex Jones\nWhat are the Health Benefits of Super Male Vitality?\n\nSuper Male Vitality is designed to aid the body in ways that may help support normal testosterone levels in men.\nSuper Male Vitality features a unique formula that is completely free of GMOs (genetically modified ingredients), harmful additives, gluten, and is made right here in the USA.\nSuper Male Vitality is the only Spagyrex processed male vitality support product on the market.\nPromotes your body's own natural responses and does not use synthetic chemicals. \n\nThe Invention of Super Male Vitality\nSuper Male Vitality is the result of ancient wisdom reinterpreted over several years in the light of modern equipment and analysis.\nThe history of Super Male Vitality is based on the proprietary Spagyrex process, which was invented during extensive research on the numerous biological deficiencies that males may experience after they age.\nThis led researcher Dr. Group on a six year journey to create the most powerful herbal male hormonal support product on the market. It all started by studying a combination of herbs that have been traditionally understood to enhance and regulate the body as well as the works of the most famous 16th century healer, scientist and formulator,\u00a0Paracelsus.\nParacelsus originally composed the word Spagyria (Spagyry), which means to extract (spao) and combine (ageiro). The word was used to describe the process and power of turning a preparation of herbs into a liquid formula dedicated to enhancing health. \nThis original technology was taken and advanced by using the science of modern day technology.\nThe Spagyrex process used in Infowars Life products combines ancient and current technologies to create a revolutionary, multi-step, proprietary herbal formula technique that does not chemically change the natural ingredients. This follows the principle of separating and recombining all the elements of an herb, to extract the most powerful essence of its healing nature. \nSuper Male Vitality Ingredients:\nPlease note: while these Asian and South American herbs have been available individually in specialty herb shops in the United States for decades, we have brought them together in a unique combination for you.\nTribulus terrestris (fruit)\nTribulus terrestris is a vigorous plant integrated into the Super Male Vitality.\u00a0 Numerous benefits regarding vitality are attributed to the plant by men worldwide. \nSuma (root)\nSuma is a ground vine with deep roots. It is native to the Amazon and other parts of South America. Suma has been in use for nearly 300 years. It's even been called \"the Russian Secret\" due to its use by Russian athletes.\nAshwaganda (root)\nBetter known as Indian ginseng, ashwaganda has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine as a key ingredient that may help to enhance energy and mental function.\nMaca (root)\nMaca, or Peruvian ginseng, is a vigorous plant that grows atop the Andes. Maca was made popular by indigenous tribes in Peru who have used the root for purposes of vitality for quite some time.\nAvena sativa (root)\nAlso known as the common oat, avena sativa contains natural compounds that may help support normal response in men.\nTongkat ali (root)\nTongkat ali, or Malaysian ginseng, is traditionally held to support a number of natural functions in men.\nCatuaba (bark)\nNative to the Amazon, catuaba is a small, flowering tree. Its bark was discovered by the Tupi tribe and described as having qualities that may aid in male vitality. \nMuira puama (bark)\nMuira puama is a small tree native to the Amazon. Practitioners of Brazilian herbal medicine reportedly use muira puama bark.\nFulvic acid\n\u00a0\nAdditional Tips for Vitality\nReduce the stress in your life. Stress can make you feel fatigued, mentally bogged down, and affect your vitality on numerous levels.\u00a0 Healthy and natural levels are supported best by a healthy body.

Raw elemental iodine is a controlled substance both at a State and Federal level. The licensing, approvals and regulatory documentary procedures are exacting and costly.Bound forms of iodine must first be separated, clarified and purified from other binding components or impurities into a USP-grade (United States Pharmaceutical), mono-elemental iodine as certified USP resublimated iodine crystals. In this purified crystal form, iodine is a highly reactive and toxic substance. However, when the purified USP iodine crystals are subjected to a proprietary process it becomes nano-colloidalized and transforms into a form of elemental nascent iodine, also referred to as monoatomic iodine, without the addition of iodides!Shocking Statistics About Iodine\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization's Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, iodine deficiency is a public health problem in 54 countries.\nThe CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world (Fortunately, it is the easiest to correct).\nThe 2013 USGS iodine commodity summary warns that there are no comparable substitutes for iodine.\nInformation published by UNICEF notes that iodine deficiency is the most avoidable cause of stunted physical and intellectual development.\n\nWhat Are The Health Benefits Of Nascent Iodine?\n\nProper iodine levels may provide support for normal response to environmental and dietary toxins.\nSupports thyroid health.\nMay support breast milk production and quality.\n\n Why Is Survival Shield X-2 The Best Nascent Iodine Available?\n\nSurvival Shield X-2 is created from salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface. \nIt is tested for radiation by our quality control experts before being placed for sale. \nIt is approximately 50% stronger than our original Survival Shield formulation. \nIt is a true glycerite of natural USP grade iodine\nThe nascent iodine in Survival Shield X-2 is not subjected to direct heat, harsh chemicals, or alcohol.\nThe transformative process produces a stable product that no other brand can match!\nCompletely non-GMO certified.\nVegan-friendly and completely non-toxic.\nIt provides high elemental iodine uptake.\nContains NO inefficient iodides.\nDoes not sting or burn.\n\nIMPORTANT SHIPPING INFORMATION:\u00a0International Customers, please check with your country's customs office regarding the import of the products.\u00a0 As the buyer, you are solely responsible for any import restrictions, prohibited import items, taxes, tariffs, fees and other duties.\nSurvival Shield X-2 now ships from a separate warehouse via USPS.

Try to incorporate the following dietary guidelines to reduce your toxin exposure while cleansing.\n\nTry to purchase organic or locally grown foods as conventional foods are often over-processed, sprayed with pesticides, or grown in nutrient depleted soil.\nTry to include healthy oils in your diet such as coconut, hemp, flax seed, or olive.\nAvoid cow's milk and cheese during the cleanse, instead try almond or hemp milk.\nAvoid foods that contain gluten, such as cereal grains, wheat, barley, white flour, pasta, bread, couscous, flour, tortillas, cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, chips, imitation fish, hot dogs, and fried foods.\nAvoid alcoholic beverages.\nAvoid diet sodas and other products often contain artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame, neotame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Substitute with natural sweeteners such as honey, stevia, or coconut sugar.\nAvoid foods that contain high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, molasses, white sugar, dextrose, sorbitol, processed fructose, and sucrose.\nReplace table salt (sodium chloride) with himalayan salt.\nAvoid soy products. Most soy contains pesticide residue and is genetically modified. Soybeans are also high in phytic acid which is damaging to the digestive tract and blocks the absorption of nutrients and essential minerals.\nCaffeine, in moderation, is acceptable during your cleanse. Try organic tea or coffee without creamers and use natural sweeteners such as raw honey.\n\nWhat To Expect During Your Liver Cleanse\nOxy-Powder can cause watery stools, so make sure a bathroom is nearby. If your stools are liquid, remember this is not diarrhea but the result of turning solid compacted fecal matter in the intestinal tract into a liquid or gas.\nA small percentage of people may experience what is known as a healing crisis. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. Don't get discouraged.\nBefore You Start: Prepare Your Liver Cleanse Formula\nThe night before you start your cleanse, make the following 2 gallons and try to go to bed before 9pm to get a good night's rest.\nHow to Make the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula\n\nMaking Gallon #1: Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula: Pour out 3 ounces from your 1st gallon of distilled or purified water and add all of the Liver Shield formula and 2 tablespoons of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV).

This will be your last meal of the day. Choose one of the following 3 options:\nOption #1: Organic Avocados, Organic Lime or Lemon, & Himalayan Crystal Salt. Eat 2-3 organic avocados. Season with salt and fresh lime or lemon juice to taste. Avocados help the body produce glutathione, which is necessary for the liver to cleanse harmful toxins.\nOption #2: Eat 6-8 ounces of raw organic walnuts. Walnuts contain the amino acid arginine, which is necessary to help the liver detoxify ammonia. Walnuts are also high in glutathione and omega-3 fatty acids which support normal liver detoxification. Make sure you chew the nuts until they are liquefied before swallowing.\nOption #3: Water Meal. If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through the afternoon, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n7:00pm - USP Epsom Salt: Mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom Salt in 8 ounces of warm purified water. Drink it as fast as you can. It is advisable to be near a bathroom when drinking the Epsom Salt as some people experience liquid stools within 20-30 minutes after ingestion.\n8:30pm to 9:00pm: Drink The Olive Oil & Juice: Drink \u00be cup (6 ounces) of organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil. A small amount (2 tablespoons) of freshly squeezed orange, grapefruit, or lemon juice may be added to improve the taste.\nHow to Drink the Olive Oil: It's important to drink all 6 ounces of the olive oil; below are three approaches to help your experience:\nApproach #1: Thicken the oil by refrigeration for a few hours prior to ingestion to make it go down quickly.\nApproach #2: Thin the oil by using a jar to mix \u00bd cup of fresh grapefruit or orange juice into the oil and shake until thin.\r\n\tApproach #3: To reduce the taste and texture, gather two cups, straw, and small amount of juice. Place the olive oil in one cup, juice in the other, and use the straw to alternate drinking between the two.\r\n\tImmediately after drinking the oil, go to bed and lie on your right side with your knees drawn up to your stomach for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, you can stretch out and go to sleep. If you experience cramping, walk around for ten minutes or so and then go back to bed. You may also feel nauseated during the night. This is due to the release of stored toxins from the liver and gallbladder. This is normal and a sign the liver cleanse is working.\nIf you feel the need to vomit, do so as this will help release toxins. If you vomit, this is a sure sign your body is extremely toxic and you should consider repeating the liver cleanse after a five day break. Do not take Oxy-Powder on this night.\nCongratulations! You have just completed your first liver cleanse.What to Expect After the Liver Cleanse\nUpon waking in the morning, immediately take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder. This will help your intestinal tract and body flush the stones released from the liver and gallbladder during the night. For breakfast, eat only fruit. For lunch eat the remaining portion of your liver cleanse soup. For dinner eat a healthy meal such as a salad and some protein.\nIf you would like to see the stones, they should appear in your bowel movements for one to two days. We recommend putting a cheap colander over the toilet to collect the stones and then rinse the fecal matter off in the sink. You will be amazed at what comes out of you.\nRepeat the Liver Cleanse if Necessary\nIf you are still experiencing indications after your third flush, this may be a sign you need additional cleanses. The most we have heard of someone completing is 20 back-to-back liver cleanses before their indications were significantly reduced.\nFrequently Asked Questions:1) Can a liver cleanse be performed if the gallbladder has been removed?Yes!\r\n When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates \r\nfor its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver,\r\n will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some \r\npatients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other \r\ngastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery \r\nsymptoms whatsoever.\u00a0Keeping\r\n the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is\r\n vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are\r\n required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and\r\n the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it \r\neasier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong \r\nbut regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a\r\n liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the \r\nsame effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\u00a03) How will I know when my liver is clean?Everyone\u2019s\r\n results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as \r\nwell as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder \r\nare never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize \r\ntoxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people\r\n require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses\r\n once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is \r\nto judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will \r\nsimply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others \r\nmay take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and \r\nresolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment,\r\n emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to \r\nbe loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the \r\nOxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages \r\nof cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in \r\nfoul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a \r\ntimely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth,\r\n and slick in appearance.4) Will I experience a healing crisis?A\r\n healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during \r\ncleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse \r\nduring and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. \r\nThe accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from \r\nthe body. This process can include physical indications caused by these \r\ntoxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common \r\nindications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental \r\nclarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or \r\nsleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple \r\nindications while others have one or none. These indications will go \r\naway in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, \r\nmany people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense \r\nof well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I \r\nstrongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process \r\nand perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and\r\n drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along\r\n with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and \r\nfar-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\u00a05) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?You\r\n may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a \r\nliver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from \r\nthe Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, \r\nwe do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who \r\ncan assist you more directly with these accommodations.\n"}, {"itemid": "AC-BCRW-1", "subcat": "Current Specials", "name": "Bill Clinton RAPE Whistle", "img": ["rapewhistle_2.png", "rape-whistle-11_1.jpg"], "price": "$103.60", "desc": "    Start the conversation and get the attention of everyone in the room.

In fact, it is essential to have a good balance of friendly bacteria in the gut for optimum health. Labeled by many as the 'good bacteria' in your gut, probiotics are living microorganisms that live in your digestive tract and support good digestive health.\nBiome Defense by Infowars Life is a probiotic and prebiotic supplement that helps populate your digestive tract with a mix of beneficial bacteria to support digestion and boost the immune system.\nMany people consider a daily probiotic to be as important to their health as a multi-vitamin, and for good reason: a healthy body requires a healthy gut!\nThe 7-Year Creation Story of Biome Defense\u2122\nFor years, Alex and Dr. Edward Group have used and recommended multiple different probiotic formulas to help replenish good bacteria in the gut. The problem was, however, that in order to get the quality and potency they wanted, they had to go out and purchase 2, 3, or even 4 different products at a time.\nAnd even then, there were issues with quality, the number of strains in the product, and of course a question of whether or not they were supporting the right companies with their purchases.\nThat's what prompted Dr. Group to begin a seven-year journey to develop the most advanced, all-in-one, full-spectrum, digestive and intestinal health probiotic formula out there*****. \nThis wasn't easy, and it took years to even start sourcing the right ingredients for the groundbreaking formula that would eventually come to be known as Biome Defense\u2122 by Infowars Life. One challenge was finding super high quality probiotics created from trustworthy sources. The other challenge was to find a probiotic company that would agree to use our non-toxic, non-GMO certified organic gum acacia, which in itself works as a prebiotic; an innovation that was a world's first in the industry. \nThe world's leading probiotic manufacturers were shocked that Dr. Group refused to settle for cheap probiotic strains with bigger margins.

Helps Boost the Immune System\nYour gut makes up a very large portion of your immune system, so it should come as no surprise that it is important to start supporting your gut health in order to help boost your immune system.\u00a0 Supporting healthy intestinal epithelium lining integrity, which is the front line for the immune system, is essential for optimal health.\n\u00a0\n3. Promotes Internal Balance\nYour gut is home to over 500 types of bacteria -- some of them are good, some of them are bad. A daily probiotic supplement like Biome Defense\u2122\u00a0 helps promote the growth of good bacteria to help 'balance out' the bad.

When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates for its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver, will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some patients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other gastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery symptoms whatsoever.\u00a0\nKeeping the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\n\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\n\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it easier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong but regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the same effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3) How will I know when my liver is clean?\nEveryone\u2019s results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as well as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder are never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize toxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is to judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will simply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others may take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and resolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment, emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to be loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the Oxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages of cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in foul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a timely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth, and slick in appearance.\n\u00a0\n4) Will I experience a healing crisis?\nA healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during cleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. This process can include physical indications caused by these toxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common indications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental clarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or sleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple indications while others have one or none. These indications will go away in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, many people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense of well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I strongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process and perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and far-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\n\u00a0\n5) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?\nYou may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a liver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from the Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, we do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who can assist you more directly with these accommodations."}, {"itemid": "IWL-LIVDEF-1", "subcat": "Current Specials", "name": "Living Defense", "img": ["livingdefense_single2.jpg", "livingdefenselabelupdate.jpg"], "price": "$44.95", "desc": " Help Eliminate Toxic & Harmful Organisms From Your Body Living Defense\u2122 is a comprehensive blend of all-natural ingredients formulated to promote the cleansing and detoxification of harmful organisms.

The green husk also contains organic iodine, which assists the cleansing of harmful organisms.Organic Epazote (leaves, seed)Rich in ascaridole, epazote is an herb of choice for attacking and expelling various harmful organisms that take up residence in the intestinal tract.Wildcrafted Quassia (bark)The Quassia grows naturally throughout South America and has a particular interesting quality -- no bugs or insects ever bother it.

Selenium even plays a role in the natural function of reproductive health, DNA production, and eyesight.\nAs a powerful antioxidant, selenium helps fight free radicals and may even be considered a super antioxidant' because of the way in which it may support other antioxidants.\nOne of its most valuable roles is supporting the natural production of glutathione peroxidase, a key antioxidant enzyme that supports the thyroid and even helps recycle vitamin E and vitamin C into active scavengers of free radicals.\nInfowars Life\u2019s high-potency Bio-True Selenium capsules are made from 100% certified organic mustard seeds and each serving delivers 200 mcg of food-derived, vegan-friendly selenium.\nThe Top 5 Reasons You Need Selenium\n1. A Powerful Antioxidant\nSelenium is an antioxidant that fights free radicals that damage cells and may lead to premature aging. Selenium\u2019s antioxidant status also helps support the immune system naturally.\n2. Healthy Thyroid Support\nMuch like iodine, selenium is important for normal thyroid function. Selenium is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones, and a selenium deficiency can negatively affect healthy hormone balance and normal thyroid function.\n3. Supports Cardiovascular Health\nSelenium plays a notable role in supporting normal cardiovascular health. Selenium can benefit heart health by soothing oxidative stress and supporting normal circulation.\n4. Food-Sourced Formula\nUnlike many selenium formulas out there, Infowars Life Bio-True Selenium\u2122 is never synthetic. It\u2019s a whole food form of selenium extracted from 100% certified organic mustard seed. Each high-potency capsule delivers 200 mcg of highly bioavailable, organically sourced selenium.\n5. Unparalleled Quality\nInfowars Life\u2019s high-potency selenium formula is produced in the USA at a state of the art manufacturing facility equipped with all modern equipment that adheres to cGMP guidelines and has achieved ISO 22000 certification -- the highest in food safety.\nInteresting Facts About Selenium\n\nSelenium concentrations decline with age.\nSelenium is more concentrated in the thyroid than any other area of the body.\nFoods reputed to be good sources of selenium include Brazil Nuts, brewer's yeast, wheat germ, garlic, grains, sunflower seeds, walnuts, raisins, and seafood.\nSoil levels of selenium can vary dramatically from one region to the next.\n\nThe Health Benefits of Selenium\n\nSelenium is one of the body's primary antioxidant enzymes\nSupports normal thyroid and immune function in healthy individuals.\nEncourages normal oxygen levels in the heart.\nSupports healthy bones and joints.\nRequired for the production of prostaglandins that promote healthy blood flow.\nIn synergy with vitamin E, selenium supports energy producing cells.\n\nThe Top 3 Questions People Ask About Selenium\n1. How much selenium is enough? The recommended dietary allowance of selenium for adults can range from 55-200mcg. Adult females may need as little as 55 mcg; adult males as little as 70 mcg; pregnant females at least 65 mcg; and 75 mcg/day for lactating females. For adults, the safe upper limit is 400 mcg/day.\n2. Why is consistent consumption of selenium important? Selenium is a trace mineral and we only need a small amount of it. However, because it plays a role in many important functions, it may get used quickly. A selenium supplement can help ensure regular and consistent availability of this important nutrient.\n3. Why is mustard seed used? Mustard seeds are an excellent, vegan-friendly source of selenium and other nutrients. In fact, Infowars Life\u2019s Bio-True Selenium\u2122 extract even offers cofactors and co-nutrients from the mustard seeds that help the activity of the selenium.\nABOUT SURVIVAL SHIELD X-2\nLeading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine, the new Infowars Life Survival Shield X-2 is now here.\u00a0New Stronger Formula From 7,000 Feet Below The SurfaceDerived from 200 million year old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface, the next level of Survival Shield is now here and much stronger than our original formula with a powerful 650 micrograms per single drop.Experience the benefits of next level proprietary nascent iodine, developed using our\u00a0Thermodynamic Pressure Sensitive High Energy Sound Pulse Nano-Emulsion Technology\u00a0that allows for a highly unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives and genetically modified ingredients.\u00a0 We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X-2 iodine for radiation during our quality control phase.\nThe Top 5 Reasons You Need Nascent Iodine\u00a0\n\nIodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health and well-being.\u00a0\u00a0\nNascent iodine may support healthy iodine levels.\u00a0\u00a0\nNascent iodine may support healthy hormone levels.\u00a0\u00a0\nNascent iodine may be involved in maintaining healthy metabolism.\nSupplementing with pure nascent iodine may provide sufficient iodine so that the body does not need to absorb iodine from other, perhaps less pure, sources.\n\nSurvival Shield X-2 QualitySurvival Shield X-2 is manufactured in a state-licensed facility that meets federal regulatory standards, is cGMP/HACCP-compliant, and lab grade.

Try to incorporate the following dietary guidelines to reduce your toxin exposure while cleansing.\n\nTry to purchase organic or locally grown foods as conventional foods are often over-processed, sprayed with pesticides, or grown in nutrient depleted soil.\nTry to include healthy oils in your diet such as coconut, hemp, flax seed, or olive.\nAvoid cow's milk and cheese during the cleanse, instead try almond or hemp milk.\nAvoid foods that contain gluten, such as cereal grains, wheat, barley, white flour, pasta, bread, couscous, flour, tortillas, cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, chips, imitation fish, hot dogs, and fried foods.\nAvoid alcoholic beverages.\nAvoid diet sodas and other products often contain artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame, neotame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Substitute with natural sweeteners such as honey, stevia, or coconut sugar.\nAvoid foods that contain high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, molasses, white sugar, dextrose, sorbitol, processed fructose, and sucrose.\nReplace table salt (sodium chloride) with himalayan salt.\nAvoid soy products. Most soy contains pesticide residue and is genetically modified. Soybeans are also high in phytic acid which is damaging to the digestive tract and blocks the absorption of nutrients and essential minerals.\nCaffeine, in moderation, is acceptable during your cleanse. Try organic tea or coffee without creamers and use natural sweeteners such as raw honey.\n\nWhat To Expect During Your Liver Cleanse\nOxy-Powder can cause watery stools, so make sure a bathroom is nearby. If your stools are liquid, remember this is not diarrhea but the result of turning solid compacted fecal matter in the intestinal tract into a liquid or gas.\nA small percentage of people may experience what is known as a healing crisis. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. Don't get discouraged.\nBefore You Start: Prepare Your Liver Cleanse Formula\nThe night before you start your cleanse, make the following 2 gallons and try to go to bed before 9pm to get a good night's rest.\nHow to Make the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula\n\nMaking Gallon #1: Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula: Pour out 3 ounces from your 1st gallon of distilled or purified water and add all of the Liver Shield formula and 2 tablespoons of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). Shake and refrigerate.\nMaking Gallon #2: Water/Apple Cider Vinegar Mixture (ACV): Pour out 2 ounces from your 2nd gallon of distilled or purified drinking water and add 1 ounce of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar. Shake and refrigerate.\n\nDay 1 - Start Your Liver Cleanse\n\n8:00am: Eat a healthy Breakfast Option (see breakfast diet options from day 1-4). Do not mix the fruits!\n9:00am: Drink one 8-ounce glass of Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n10:00-11:00am: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n12:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n1:00pm: Eat healthy Lunch Meal (see lunch diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your lunch meal.\n3:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n4:00-5:00pm: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n6:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n7:00pm: Eat healthy Dinner Meal (see dinner diet options from day 1-4).

Do not go to bed past 10pm!\n\nDays Two, Three, and Four of Your Liver Cleanse\nFollow the same instructions as Day 1, however, from 8:00-10:00pm: take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder.\nDay 5 of Your Liver Cleanse - Flush Day\u009d\n8:00am to 10:00am - Breakfast Meal (see breakfast diet options for day 5). Do not mix the fruits! We recommend using watermelon if it is available due to its high glutathione content.\nAfter breakfast, start preparing your Liver Cleanse Soup for lunch (see the recipe below) if you choose Option #1. Drink the Water/ACV Mixture as needed until lunch.\n12:00pm - Liver Supporting Lunch Meal. Choose from one of the following 3 options for your lunch meal:\nOption #1 - Liver Cleanse Soup (Recommended)\nTo maximize the liver's ability to detox and cleanse, choose a combination of foods which are high in naturally occurring sulphur and glutathione. Sulphur helps the liver cleanse harmful chemicals.\nThe ingredients in the liver cleanse soup include the following:\n\n1 Organic Beet (Washed and Chopped)\n2 Organic Carrots (Chopped)\n1 Cup Broccoli (Chopped)\n10 Organic Garlic Cloves (Minced)\n\u00bd Organic Onion (Chopped)\n\u00bc Organic Lemon\n2 Bay Leaves\n1 Teaspoon Himalayan Crystal Salt\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Turmeric\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Oregano\nOther liver cleansing foods you can use:artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, kale, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower can be added to the soup.\n\nTo prepare the Liver Cleanse Soup: Wash vegetables. Finely chop ingredients to desired consistency. Pour 32 ounces of distilled or purified water into a soup pot. Add all of the ingredients to the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and then simmer on low heat for one hour. Eat this soup for your lunch meal. After your meal, refrigerate the remaining portion of your soup for tomorrow's lunch meal (Day 6).\nOption #2 - Beet/Carrot Juice (Alternate):\n\nPeel and juice ingredients in a blender until desired consistency is achieved.\n3 Organic Carrots (washed and peeled)\n1 Organic Beet (washed and peeled)\n2 Organic Red Apples (washed and cut)\n6 Organic Kale Leaves\n\u00bd Organic Lemon (washed and peeled)\n\u00bd inch Ginger Root\n\nOption 3: (Water/ACV Mixture) - If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through lunch, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n2:00pm - Mid-Afternoon Snack. This will be your last meal of the day. Choose one of the following 3 options:\nOption #1: Organic Avocados, Organic Lime or Lemon, & Himalayan Crystal Salt. Eat 2-3 organic avocados. Season with salt and fresh lime or lemon juice to taste. Avocados help the body produce glutathione, which is necessary for the liver to cleanse harmful toxins.\nOption #2: Eat 6-8 ounces of raw organic walnuts. Walnuts contain the amino acid arginine, which is necessary to help the liver detoxify ammonia. Walnuts are also high in glutathione and omega-3 fatty acids which support normal liver detoxification. Make sure you chew the nuts until they are liquefied before swallowing.\nOption #3: Water Meal. If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through the afternoon, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n7:00pm - USP Epsom Salt: Mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom Salt in 8 ounces of warm purified water. Drink it as fast as you can. It is advisable to be near a bathroom when drinking the Epsom Salt as some people experience liquid stools within 20-30 minutes after ingestion.\n8:30pm to 9:00pm: Drink The Olive Oil & Juice: Drink \u00be cup (6 ounces) of organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil. A small amount (2 tablespoons) of freshly squeezed orange, grapefruit, or lemon juice may be added to improve the taste.\nHow to Drink the Olive Oil: It's important to drink all 6 ounces of the olive oil; below are three approaches to help your experience:\nApproach #1: Thicken the oil by refrigeration for a few hours prior to ingestion to make it go down quickly.\nApproach #2: Thin the oil by using a jar to mix \u00bd cup of fresh grapefruit or orange juice into the oil and shake until thin.\r\n\tApproach #3: To reduce the taste and texture, gather two cups, straw, and small amount of juice. Place the olive oil in one cup, juice in the other, and use the straw to alternate drinking between the two.\r\n\tImmediately after drinking the oil, go to bed and lie on your right side with your knees drawn up to your stomach for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, you can stretch out and go to sleep. If you experience cramping, walk around for ten minutes or so and then go back to bed. You may also feel nauseated during the night. This is due to the release of stored toxins from the liver and gallbladder. This is normal and a sign the liver cleanse is working.\nIf you feel the need to vomit, do so as this will help release toxins. If you vomit, this is a sure sign your body is extremely toxic and you should consider repeating the liver cleanse after a five day break. Do not take Oxy-Powder on this night.\nCongratulations! You have just completed your first liver cleanse.What to Expect After the Liver Cleanse\nUpon waking in the morning, immediately take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder. This will help your intestinal tract and body flush the stones released from the liver and gallbladder during the night. For breakfast, eat only fruit. For lunch eat the remaining portion of your liver cleanse soup. For dinner eat a healthy meal such as a salad and some protein.\nIf you would like to see the stones, they should appear in your bowel movements for one to two days. We recommend putting a cheap colander over the toilet to collect the stones and then rinse the fecal matter off in the sink. You will be amazed at what comes out of you.\nRepeat the Liver Cleanse if Necessary\nIf you are still experiencing indications after your third flush, this may be a sign you need additional cleanses. The most we have heard of someone completing is 20 back-to-back liver cleanses before their indications were significantly reduced.\nFrequently Asked Questions:1) Can a liver cleanse be performed if the gallbladder has been removed?Yes!\r\n When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates \r\nfor its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver,\r\n will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some \r\npatients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other \r\ngastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery \r\nsymptoms whatsoever.\u00a0Keeping\r\n the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is\r\n vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are\r\n required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and\r\n the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it \r\neasier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong \r\nbut regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a\r\n liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the \r\nsame effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\u00a03) How will I know when my liver is clean?Everyone\u2019s\r\n results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as \r\nwell as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder \r\nare never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize \r\ntoxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people\r\n require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses\r\n once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is \r\nto judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will \r\nsimply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others \r\nmay take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and \r\nresolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment,\r\n emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to \r\nbe loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the \r\nOxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages \r\nof cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in \r\nfoul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a \r\ntimely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth,\r\n and slick in appearance.4) Will I experience a healing crisis?A\r\n healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during \r\ncleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse \r\nduring and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. \r\nThe accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from \r\nthe body. This process can include physical indications caused by these \r\ntoxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common \r\nindications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental \r\nclarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or \r\nsleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple \r\nindications while others have one or none. These indications will go \r\naway in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, \r\nmany people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense \r\nof well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I \r\nstrongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process \r\nand perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and\r\n drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along\r\n with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and \r\nfar-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\u00a05) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?You\r\n may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a \r\nliver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from \r\nthe Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, \r\nwe do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who \r\ncan assist you more directly with these accommodations.\n"}, {"itemid": "EE-BUGSPRAY-NB-1", "subcat": "Health & Wellness Specials", "name": "Herbal Bug Spray - Emric's Essentials", "img": ["b-away_bug_spray-thumbnail.png", "bug_spray_label.png"], "price": "$19.95", "desc": " B-Away Spray (Made with Organic)\nSize: 4 ounce\nAll-Natural, Made from Organic Ingredients, Herbal Outdoor Spray\nA DEET-Free Spray with Aromatherapy Oils to Help Protect Your Skin\n\nNo N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET)\nMade from organic ingredients\nAlcohol and mineral oil free\nNo petroleum based ingredients\nNo parabens or preservatives\nNo synthetic additives or scents\nVegetarian, vegan and non-GMO\nFree from artificial colors or preservatives\nFree from yeast, gluten, dairy, soy and corn\nBPA-Free 4oz Bottle\n\nBest Way to Dodge Those Pesky Bugs\nYou probably like to spend most of your summer outdoors and unfortunately having to share your space with bugs is inevitable.

During this time we've found that so many 'staple' formulations have not yet been advanced with new leaps in nutraceutical science. We asked, why is everyone else developing processed, synthetic forms of vitamin B-12 that are loaded with fillers?Low quality B-12 formulations can have serious problems when it comes to their affect on the body, their purity, and of course what's known as their 'bio-active' abilities. That's why many are having to resort to painful B-12 injections, which require needles and may come with a lot of pain. What is the Infowars Life Secret 12 B Vitamin Formula?Although most of us simply know vitamin B-12 as the B vitamin responsible for energy production, it's important to understand that vitamin B-12 is actually a catch-all term for a class of vitamins known as cobalamins -- cyanocobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, methycobalamin, and adenosylcobalamin -- and they are not equal in their benefits. Whereas traditional B-12 supplements contain cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalmin, Infowars Life Secret 12 contains methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalmin, specifically chosen from all other forms for their bioactive characteristics. The Top 5 Reasons You Need Infowars Life Secret 121.\u00a0 Encourages Normal Energy LevelsVitamin B-12 promotes energy production in multiple ways. It helps to support the body's natural processes of the adrenal glands, red blood cell formation, and may help convert carbohydrates to glucose -- the fuel your body uses for energy.2.\u00a0 You Want the Purest, Most Advanced B Vitamin BlendMethylcobalamin, or methylated B-12 is the select coenzyme form of B-12 used in Secret 12, and when paired with adenosylcobalamin, the other coenzyme form of B-12, forms the key blend that makes Secret 12 so special.3. Help The Body Fight B-12 DeficiencyB-12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.4. Supports Your Body's Major ProcessesAs defense against homocysteine, B-12 is nutritional support for numerous essential bodily functions. 5.

It's the Super Male you've been taking, with an extra punch. \n\nAlso Available: Super Female Vitality\n\nAfter reviewing the individual herbal components in the original Super Male Vitality, we decided we could enhance the potency by using higher concentrations of some herbs while lowering the concentrations of other herbs.\u00a0 We also advanced our extraction technology to stabilize more of the active plant compounds and essential oils without oxidation, in order to enhance the natural support and strength of Super Male Vitality by a considerable amount.The new Super Male Vitality also contains fulvic acid, which works to carry the individual components of the herbs deep into the body while also providing powerful benefits to the bioavailability of the finished extract. \nIntroducing Super Male Vitality\nAs men age, they may often experience a slow-down in vitality, energy, and overall wellness. Super Male Vitality is specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males, and has been used by Alex Jones in order to maximize vitality when working up to 12 hours a day or more in the fight for freedom. \n\"When I spoke to Dr. Edward Group about formulating a male vitality formula, I was excited about the idea of what it could do for me.

This is literally an infusion of the highest quality sources and naturally derived essences. I only bring the best formulations and products to my listeners, and Super Male Vitality has passed all of my expectations.\" - Alex Jones\nWhat are the Health Benefits of Super Male Vitality?\n\nSuper Male Vitality is designed to aid the body in ways that may help support normal testosterone levels in men.\nSuper Male Vitality features a unique formula that is completely free of GMOs (genetically modified ingredients), harmful additives, gluten, and is made right here in the USA.\nSuper Male Vitality is the only Spagyrex processed male vitality support product on the market.\nPromotes your body's own natural responses and does not use synthetic chemicals. \n\nThe Invention of Super Male Vitality\nSuper Male Vitality is the result of ancient wisdom reinterpreted over several years in the light of modern equipment and analysis.\nThe history of Super Male Vitality is based on the proprietary Spagyrex process, which was invented during extensive research on the numerous biological deficiencies that males may experience after they age.\nThis led researcher Dr. Group on a six year journey to create the most powerful herbal male hormonal support product on the market. It all started by studying a combination of herbs that have been traditionally understood to enhance and regulate the body as well as the works of the most famous 16th century healer, scientist and formulator,\u00a0Paracelsus.\nParacelsus originally composed the word Spagyria (Spagyry), which means to extract (spao) and combine (ageiro). The word was used to describe the process and power of turning a preparation of herbs into a liquid formula dedicated to enhancing health. \nThis original technology was taken and advanced by using the science of modern day technology.\nThe Spagyrex process used in Infowars Life products combines ancient and current technologies to create a revolutionary, multi-step, proprietary herbal formula technique that does not chemically change the natural ingredients. This follows the principle of separating and recombining all the elements of an herb, to extract the most powerful essence of its healing nature. \nSuper Male Vitality Ingredients:\nPlease note: while these Asian and South American herbs have been available individually in specialty herb shops in the United States for decades, we have brought them together in a unique combination for you.\nTribulus terrestris (fruit)\nTribulus terrestris is a vigorous plant integrated into the Super Male Vitality.\u00a0 Numerous benefits regarding vitality are attributed to the plant by men worldwide. \nSuma (root)\nSuma is a ground vine with deep roots. It is native to the Amazon and other parts of South America. Suma has been in use for nearly 300 years. It's even been called \"the Russian Secret\" due to its use by Russian athletes.\nAshwaganda (root)\nBetter known as Indian ginseng, ashwaganda has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine as a key ingredient that may help to enhance energy and mental function.\nMaca (root)\nMaca, or Peruvian ginseng, is a vigorous plant that grows atop the Andes. Maca was made popular by indigenous tribes in Peru who have used the root for purposes of vitality for quite some time.\nAvena sativa (root)\nAlso known as the common oat, avena sativa contains natural compounds that may help support normal response in men.\nTongkat ali (root)\nTongkat ali, or Malaysian ginseng, is traditionally held to support a number of natural functions in men.\nCatuaba (bark)\nNative to the Amazon, catuaba is a small, flowering tree. Its bark was discovered by the Tupi tribe and described as having qualities that may aid in male vitality. \nMuira puama (bark)\nMuira puama is a small tree native to the Amazon. Practitioners of Brazilian herbal medicine reportedly use muira puama bark.\nFulvic acid\n\u00a0\nAdditional Tips for Vitality\nReduce the stress in your life.

Try to incorporate the following dietary guidelines to reduce your toxin exposure while cleansing.\n\nTry to purchase organic or locally grown foods as conventional foods are often over-processed, sprayed with pesticides, or grown in nutrient depleted soil.\nTry to include healthy oils in your diet such as coconut, hemp, flax seed, or olive.\nAvoid cow's milk and cheese during the cleanse, instead try almond or hemp milk.\nAvoid foods that contain gluten, such as cereal grains, wheat, barley, white flour, pasta, bread, couscous, flour, tortillas, cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, chips, imitation fish, hot dogs, and fried foods.\nAvoid alcoholic beverages.\nAvoid diet sodas and other products often contain artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame, neotame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Substitute with natural sweeteners such as honey, stevia, or coconut sugar.\nAvoid foods that contain high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, molasses, white sugar, dextrose, sorbitol, processed fructose, and sucrose.\nReplace table salt (sodium chloride) with himalayan salt.\nAvoid soy products. Most soy contains pesticide residue and is genetically modified. Soybeans are also high in phytic acid which is damaging to the digestive tract and blocks the absorption of nutrients and essential minerals.\nCaffeine, in moderation, is acceptable during your cleanse. Try organic tea or coffee without creamers and use natural sweeteners such as raw honey.\n\nWhat To Expect During Your Liver Cleanse\nOxy-Powder can cause watery stools, so make sure a bathroom is nearby. If your stools are liquid, remember this is not diarrhea but the result of turning solid compacted fecal matter in the intestinal tract into a liquid or gas.\nA small percentage of people may experience what is known as a healing crisis. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. Don't get discouraged.\nBefore You Start: Prepare Your Liver Cleanse Formula\nThe night before you start your cleanse, make the following 2 gallons and try to go to bed before 9pm to get a good night's rest.\nHow to Make the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula\n\nMaking Gallon #1: Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula: Pour out 3 ounces from your 1st gallon of distilled or purified water and add all of the Liver Shield formula and 2 tablespoons of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). Shake and refrigerate.\nMaking Gallon #2: Water/Apple Cider Vinegar Mixture (ACV): Pour out 2 ounces from your 2nd gallon of distilled or purified drinking water and add 1 ounce of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar. Shake and refrigerate.\n\nDay 1 - Start Your Liver Cleanse\n\n8:00am: Eat a healthy Breakfast Option (see breakfast diet options from day 1-4). Do not mix the fruits!\n9:00am: Drink one 8-ounce glass of Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n10:00-11:00am: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n12:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n1:00pm: Eat healthy Lunch Meal (see lunch diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your lunch meal.\n3:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n4:00-5:00pm: Water and Snack (optional).

Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your dinner meal.\n8:00-10:00pm: Before bed, take 4 capsules of Oxy-Powder. Do not go to bed past 10pm!\n\nDays Two, Three, and Four of Your Liver Cleanse\nFollow the same instructions as Day 1, however, from 8:00-10:00pm: take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder.\nDay 5 of Your Liver Cleanse - Flush Day\u009d\n8:00am to 10:00am - Breakfast Meal (see breakfast diet options for day 5). Do not mix the fruits! We recommend using watermelon if it is available due to its high glutathione content.\nAfter breakfast, start preparing your Liver Cleanse Soup for lunch (see the recipe below) if you choose Option #1. Drink the Water/ACV Mixture as needed until lunch.\n12:00pm - Liver Supporting Lunch Meal. Choose from one of the following 3 options for your lunch meal:\nOption #1 - Liver Cleanse Soup (Recommended)\nTo maximize the liver's ability to detox and cleanse, choose a combination of foods which are high in naturally occurring sulphur and glutathione. Sulphur helps the liver cleanse harmful chemicals.\nThe ingredients in the liver cleanse soup include the following:\n\n1 Organic Beet (Washed and Chopped)\n2 Organic Carrots (Chopped)\n1 Cup Broccoli (Chopped)\n10 Organic Garlic Cloves (Minced)\n\u00bd Organic Onion (Chopped)\n\u00bc Organic Lemon\n2 Bay Leaves\n1 Teaspoon Himalayan Crystal Salt\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Turmeric\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Oregano\nOther liver cleansing foods you can use:artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, kale, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower can be added to the soup.\n\nTo prepare the Liver Cleanse Soup: Wash vegetables. Finely chop ingredients to desired consistency. Pour 32 ounces of distilled or purified water into a soup pot. Add all of the ingredients to the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and then simmer on low heat for one hour. Eat this soup for your lunch meal. After your meal, refrigerate the remaining portion of your soup for tomorrow's lunch meal (Day 6).\nOption #2 - Beet/Carrot Juice (Alternate):\n\nPeel and juice ingredients in a blender until desired consistency is achieved.\n3 Organic Carrots (washed and peeled)\n1 Organic Beet (washed and peeled)\n2 Organic Red Apples (washed and cut)\n6 Organic Kale Leaves\n\u00bd Organic Lemon (washed and peeled)\n\u00bd inch Ginger Root\n\nOption 3: (Water/ACV Mixture) - If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through lunch, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n2:00pm - Mid-Afternoon Snack. This will be your last meal of the day. Choose one of the following 3 options:\nOption #1: Organic Avocados, Organic Lime or Lemon, & Himalayan Crystal Salt. Eat 2-3 organic avocados. Season with salt and fresh lime or lemon juice to taste. Avocados help the body produce glutathione, which is necessary for the liver to cleanse harmful toxins.\nOption #2: Eat 6-8 ounces of raw organic walnuts. Walnuts contain the amino acid arginine, which is necessary to help the liver detoxify ammonia. Walnuts are also high in glutathione and omega-3 fatty acids which support normal liver detoxification. Make sure you chew the nuts until they are liquefied before swallowing.\nOption #3: Water Meal. If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through the afternoon, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n7:00pm - USP Epsom Salt: Mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom Salt in 8 ounces of warm purified water. Drink it as fast as you can. It is advisable to be near a bathroom when drinking the Epsom Salt as some people experience liquid stools within 20-30 minutes after ingestion.\n8:30pm to 9:00pm: Drink The Olive Oil & Juice: Drink \u00be cup (6 ounces) of organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil. A small amount (2 tablespoons) of freshly squeezed orange, grapefruit, or lemon juice may be added to improve the taste.\nHow to Drink the Olive Oil: It's important to drink all 6 ounces of the olive oil; below are three approaches to help your experience:\nApproach #1: Thicken the oil by refrigeration for a few hours prior to ingestion to make it go down quickly.\nApproach #2: Thin the oil by using a jar to mix \u00bd cup of fresh grapefruit or orange juice into the oil and shake until thin.\r\n\tApproach #3: To reduce the taste and texture, gather two cups, straw, and small amount of juice. Place the olive oil in one cup, juice in the other, and use the straw to alternate drinking between the two.\r\n\tImmediately after drinking the oil, go to bed and lie on your right side with your knees drawn up to your stomach for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, you can stretch out and go to sleep. If you experience cramping, walk around for ten minutes or so and then go back to bed. You may also feel nauseated during the night. This is due to the release of stored toxins from the liver and gallbladder. This is normal and a sign the liver cleanse is working.\nIf you feel the need to vomit, do so as this will help release toxins. If you vomit, this is a sure sign your body is extremely toxic and you should consider repeating the liver cleanse after a five day break. Do not take Oxy-Powder on this night.\nCongratulations! You have just completed your first liver cleanse.What to Expect After the Liver Cleanse\nUpon waking in the morning, immediately take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder. This will help your intestinal tract and body flush the stones released from the liver and gallbladder during the night. For breakfast, eat only fruit. For lunch eat the remaining portion of your liver cleanse soup. For dinner eat a healthy meal such as a salad and some protein.\nIf you would like to see the stones, they should appear in your bowel movements for one to two days. We recommend putting a cheap colander over the toilet to collect the stones and then rinse the fecal matter off in the sink. You will be amazed at what comes out of you.\nRepeat the Liver Cleanse if Necessary\nIf you are still experiencing indications after your third flush, this may be a sign you need additional cleanses. The most we have heard of someone completing is 20 back-to-back liver cleanses before their indications were significantly reduced.\nFrequently Asked Questions:1) Can a liver cleanse be performed if the gallbladder has been removed?Yes!\r\n When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates \r\nfor its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver,\r\n will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some \r\npatients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other \r\ngastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery \r\nsymptoms whatsoever.\u00a0Keeping\r\n the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is\r\n vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are\r\n required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and\r\n the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it \r\neasier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong \r\nbut regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a\r\n liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the \r\nsame effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\u00a03) How will I know when my liver is clean?Everyone\u2019s\r\n results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as \r\nwell as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder \r\nare never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize \r\ntoxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people\r\n require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses\r\n once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is \r\nto judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will \r\nsimply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others \r\nmay take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and \r\nresolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment,\r\n emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to \r\nbe loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the \r\nOxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages \r\nof cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in \r\nfoul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a \r\ntimely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth,\r\n and slick in appearance.4) Will I experience a healing crisis?A\r\n healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during \r\ncleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse \r\nduring and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. \r\nThe accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from \r\nthe body. This process can include physical indications caused by these \r\ntoxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common \r\nindications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental \r\nclarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or \r\nsleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple \r\nindications while others have one or none. These indications will go \r\naway in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, \r\nmany people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense \r\nof well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I \r\nstrongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process \r\nand perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and\r\n drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along\r\n with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and \r\nfar-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\u00a05) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?You\r\n may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a \r\nliver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from \r\nthe Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, \r\nwe do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who \r\ncan assist you more directly with these accommodations.\n"}, {"itemid": "IWL-ANPLX-1", "subcat": "Infowars Life Specials", "name": "Anthroplex", "img": ["anthroplex-tumbnail.jpg", "anthroplex-label.jpg"], "price": "$39.95", "desc": " Introducing Anthroplex, the twice daily pill foundation for men that contains key compounds like horny goat weed, zinc orotate, and a newly balanced blend of hand-selected organic herbs.\n\u00a0\nWhat You've Been Asking For: Anthroplex Is Finally Here\nFor years, listeners have been asking us to add certain ingredients like horny goat weed and zinc orotate to the Super Male Vitality formula, but the years of research and testing put into the precisely balanced Super Male Vitality formula have proven that the exact ratios of the cold pressed organic herbs are essential to maintain.\nThat's why Anthroplex works synergistically with the powerful Super Male Vitality formula in order to help restore your masculine foundation and stimulate vitality with its own blend of unique ingredients.\n\u00a0\nAnthroplex's Unique Formula & Ingredients\n\u00a0\nZinc Orotate\nZinc is an essential dietary mineral that's necessary for proper healthy immune system function, the normal breakdown of food and nutrients, and a number of other processes within the body pertaining to vitality.\n\u00a0\nHorny Goat Weed - Epimedium\nHorny goat weed, or epimedium, is an herb that has been used for ages in Chinese medicine for vitality, and has also been noted for its antioxidant activity.\n\u00a0\nTribulus Terrestris\nTribulus Terrestris has been used in Ayurvedic practice as an herb of choice for vitality, and is noted to contain a compound called protodioscin, which is the putative active component of the herb.\n\u00a0\nTongKat Ali\nAlso known as Malaysian ginseng, TongKat Ali has been traditionally held to support a number of natural functions in men, and was specifically added to the Anthroplex formula using a very specific ingredient ratio.\n\u00a0\nNow Is The Time...\nNow is the time to start fighting back and rebuilding your foundation.

When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates for its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver, will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some patients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other gastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery symptoms whatsoever.\u00a0\nKeeping the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\n\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\n\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it easier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong but regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the same effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3) How will I know when my liver is clean?\nEveryone\u2019s results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as well as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder are never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize toxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is to judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will simply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others may take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and resolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment, emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to be loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the Oxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages of cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in foul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a timely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth, and slick in appearance.\n\u00a0\n4) Will I experience a healing crisis?\nA healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during cleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. This process can include physical indications caused by these toxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common indications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental clarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or sleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple indications while others have one or none. These indications will go away in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, many people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense of well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I strongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process and perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along with plenty of rest may help you to feel better.

When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates for its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver, will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some patients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other gastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery symptoms whatsoever.\u00a0\nKeeping the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\n\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\n\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it easier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong but regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the same effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3) How will I know when my liver is clean?\nEveryone\u2019s results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as well as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder are never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize toxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is to judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will simply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others may take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and resolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment, emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to be loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the Oxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages of cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in foul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a timely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth, and slick in appearance.\n\u00a0\n4) Will I experience a healing crisis?\nA healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during cleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. This process can include physical indications caused by these toxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common indications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental clarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or sleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple indications while others have one or none. These indications will go away in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, many people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense of well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I strongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process and perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along with plenty of rest may help you to feel better.

It all started by studying a combination of herbs that have been traditionally understood to enhance and regulate the body as well as the works of the most famous 16th century healer, scientist and formulator,\u00a0Paracelsus.\nParacelsus originally composed the word Spagyria (Spagyry), which means to extract (spao) and combine (ageiro). The word was used to describe the process and power of turning a preparation of herbs into a liquid formula dedicated to enhancing health. \nThis original technology was taken and advanced by using the science of modern day technology.\nThe Spagyrex process used in Infowars Life products combines ancient and current technologies to create a revolutionary, multi-step, proprietary herbal formula technique that does not chemically change the natural ingredients.

Selenium even plays a role in the natural function of reproductive health, DNA production, and eyesight.\nAs a powerful antioxidant, selenium helps fight free radicals and may even be considered a super antioxidant' because of the way in which it may support other antioxidants.\nOne of its most valuable roles is supporting the natural production of glutathione peroxidase, a key antioxidant enzyme that supports the thyroid and even helps recycle vitamin E and vitamin C into active scavengers of free radicals.\nInfowars Life\u2019s high-potency Bio-True Selenium capsules are made from 100% certified organic mustard seeds and each serving delivers 200 mcg of food-derived, vegan-friendly selenium.\nThe Top 5 Reasons You Need Selenium\n1. A Powerful Antioxidant\nSelenium is an antioxidant that fights free radicals that damage cells and may lead to premature aging. Selenium\u2019s antioxidant status also helps support the immune system naturally.\n2. Healthy Thyroid Support\nMuch like iodine, selenium is important for normal thyroid function. Selenium is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones, and a selenium deficiency can negatively affect healthy hormone balance and normal thyroid function.\n3. Supports Cardiovascular Health\nSelenium plays a notable role in supporting normal cardiovascular health. Selenium can benefit heart health by soothing oxidative stress and supporting normal circulation.\n4. Food-Sourced Formula\nUnlike many selenium formulas out there, Infowars Life Bio-True Selenium\u2122 is never synthetic. It\u2019s a whole food form of selenium extracted from 100% certified organic mustard seed. Each high-potency capsule delivers 200 mcg of highly bioavailable, organically sourced selenium.\n5. Unparalleled Quality\nInfowars Life\u2019s high-potency selenium formula is produced in the USA at a state of the art manufacturing facility equipped with all modern equipment that adheres to cGMP guidelines and has achieved ISO 22000 certification -- the highest in food safety.\nInteresting Facts About Selenium\n\nSelenium concentrations decline with age.\nSelenium is more concentrated in the thyroid than any other area of the body.\nFoods reputed to be good sources of selenium include Brazil Nuts, brewer's yeast, wheat germ, garlic, grains, sunflower seeds, walnuts, raisins, and seafood.\nSoil levels of selenium can vary dramatically from one region to the next.\n\nThe Health Benefits of Selenium\n\nSelenium is one of the body's primary antioxidant enzymes\nSupports normal thyroid and immune function in healthy individuals.\nEncourages normal oxygen levels in the heart.\nSupports healthy bones and joints.\nRequired for the production of prostaglandins that promote healthy blood flow.\nIn synergy with vitamin E, selenium supports energy producing cells.\n\nThe Top 3 Questions People Ask About Selenium\n1. How much selenium is enough? The recommended dietary allowance of selenium for adults can range from 55-200mcg. Adult females may need as little as 55 mcg; adult males as little as 70 mcg; pregnant females at least 65 mcg; and 75 mcg/day for lactating females. For adults, the safe upper limit is 400 mcg/day.\n2. Why is consistent consumption of selenium important? Selenium is a trace mineral and we only need a small amount of it. However, because it plays a role in many important functions, it may get used quickly. A selenium supplement can help ensure regular and consistent availability of this important nutrient.\n3. Why is mustard seed used? Mustard seeds are an excellent, vegan-friendly source of selenium and other nutrients. In fact, Infowars Life\u2019s Bio-True Selenium\u2122 extract even offers cofactors and co-nutrients from the mustard seeds that help the activity of the selenium.\nABOUT SURVIVAL SHIELD X-2\nLeading the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine, the new Infowars Life Survival Shield X-2 is now here.\u00a0New Stronger Formula From 7,000 Feet Below The SurfaceDerived from 200 million year old salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface, the next level of Survival Shield is now here and much stronger than our original formula with a powerful 650 micrograms per single drop.Experience the benefits of next level proprietary nascent iodine, developed using our\u00a0Thermodynamic Pressure Sensitive High Energy Sound Pulse Nano-Emulsion Technology\u00a0that allows for a highly unique nascent iodine that is both concentrated and free of unwanted additives and genetically modified ingredients.\u00a0 We even pre-screen our Survival Shield X-2 iodine for radiation during our quality control phase.\nThe Top 5 Reasons You Need Nascent Iodine\u00a0\n\nIodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health and well-being.\u00a0\u00a0\nNascent iodine may support healthy iodine levels.\u00a0\u00a0\nNascent iodine may support healthy hormone levels.\u00a0\u00a0\nNascent iodine may be involved in maintaining healthy metabolism.\nSupplementing with pure nascent iodine may provide sufficient iodine so that the body does not need to absorb iodine from other, perhaps less pure, sources.\n\nSurvival Shield X-2 QualitySurvival Shield X-2 is manufactured in a state-licensed facility that meets federal regulatory standards, is cGMP/HACCP-compliant, and lab grade.
