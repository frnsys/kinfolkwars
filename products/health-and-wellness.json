Try to incorporate the following dietary guidelines to reduce your toxin exposure while cleansing.\n\nTry to purchase organic or locally grown foods as conventional foods are often over-processed, sprayed with pesticides, or grown in nutrient depleted soil.\nTry to include healthy oils in your diet such as coconut, hemp, flax seed, or olive.\nAvoid cow's milk and cheese during the cleanse, instead try almond or hemp milk.\nAvoid foods that contain gluten, such as cereal grains, wheat, barley, white flour, pasta, bread, couscous, flour, tortillas, cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, chips, imitation fish, hot dogs, and fried foods.\nAvoid alcoholic beverages.\nAvoid diet sodas and other products often contain artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame, neotame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Substitute with natural sweeteners such as honey, stevia, or coconut sugar.\nAvoid foods that contain high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, molasses, white sugar, dextrose, sorbitol, processed fructose, and sucrose.\nReplace table salt (sodium chloride) with himalayan salt.\nAvoid soy products. Most soy contains pesticide residue and is genetically modified. Soybeans are also high in phytic acid which is damaging to the digestive tract and blocks the absorption of nutrients and essential minerals.\nCaffeine, in moderation, is acceptable during your cleanse. Try organic tea or coffee without creamers and use natural sweeteners such as raw honey.\n\nWhat To Expect During Your Liver Cleanse\nOxy-Powder can cause watery stools, so make sure a bathroom is nearby. If your stools are liquid, remember this is not diarrhea but the result of turning solid compacted fecal matter in the intestinal tract into a liquid or gas.\nA small percentage of people may experience what is known as a healing crisis. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. Don't get discouraged.\nBefore You Start: Prepare Your Liver Cleanse Formula\nThe night before you start your cleanse, make the following 2 gallons and try to go to bed before 9pm to get a good night's rest.\nHow to Make the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula\n\nMaking Gallon #1: Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula: Pour out 3 ounces from your 1st gallon of distilled or purified water and add all of the Liver Shield formula and 2 tablespoons of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). Shake and refrigerate.\nMaking Gallon #2: Water/Apple Cider Vinegar Mixture (ACV): Pour out 2 ounces from your 2nd gallon of distilled or purified drinking water and add 1 ounce of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar. Shake and refrigerate.\n\nDay 1 - Start Your Liver Cleanse\n\n8:00am: Eat a healthy Breakfast Option (see breakfast diet options from day 1-4). Do not mix the fruits!\n9:00am: Drink one 8-ounce glass of Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n10:00-11:00am: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n12:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n1:00pm: Eat healthy Lunch Meal (see lunch diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your lunch meal.\n3:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n4:00-5:00pm: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n6:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n7:00pm: Eat healthy Dinner Meal (see dinner diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your dinner meal.\n8:00-10:00pm: Before bed, take 4 capsules of Oxy-Powder. Do not go to bed past 10pm!\n\nDays Two, Three, and Four of Your Liver Cleanse\nFollow the same instructions as Day 1, however, from 8:00-10:00pm: take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder.\nDay 5 of Your Liver Cleanse - Flush Day\u009d\n8:00am to 10:00am - Breakfast Meal (see breakfast diet options for day 5). Do not mix the fruits! We recommend using watermelon if it is available due to its high glutathione content.\nAfter breakfast, start preparing your Liver Cleanse Soup for lunch (see the recipe below) if you choose Option #1. Drink the Water/ACV Mixture as needed until lunch.\n12:00pm - Liver Supporting Lunch Meal. Choose from one of the following 3 options for your lunch meal:\nOption #1 - Liver Cleanse Soup (Recommended)\nTo maximize the liver's ability to detox and cleanse, choose a combination of foods which are high in naturally occurring sulphur and glutathione. Sulphur helps the liver cleanse harmful chemicals.\nThe ingredients in the liver cleanse soup include the following:\n\n1 Organic Beet (Washed and Chopped)\n2 Organic Carrots (Chopped)\n1 Cup Broccoli (Chopped)\n10 Organic Garlic Cloves (Minced)\n\u00bd Organic Onion (Chopped)\n\u00bc Organic Lemon\n2 Bay Leaves\n1 Teaspoon Himalayan Crystal Salt\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Turmeric\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Oregano\nOther liver cleansing foods you can use:artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, kale, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower can be added to the soup.\n\nTo prepare the Liver Cleanse Soup: Wash vegetables. Finely chop ingredients to desired consistency. Pour 32 ounces of distilled or purified water into a soup pot. Add all of the ingredients to the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and then simmer on low heat for one hour. Eat this soup for your lunch meal. After your meal, refrigerate the remaining portion of your soup for tomorrow's lunch meal (Day 6).\nOption #2 - Beet/Carrot Juice (Alternate):\n\nPeel and juice ingredients in a blender until desired consistency is achieved.\n3 Organic Carrots (washed and peeled)\n1 Organic Beet (washed and peeled)\n2 Organic Red Apples (washed and cut)\n6 Organic Kale Leaves\n\u00bd Organic Lemon (washed and peeled)\n\u00bd inch Ginger Root\n\nOption 3: (Water/ACV Mixture) - If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through lunch, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n2:00pm - Mid-Afternoon Snack. This will be your last meal of the day. Choose one of the following 3 options:\nOption #1: Organic Avocados, Organic Lime or Lemon, & Himalayan Crystal Salt. Eat 2-3 organic avocados. Season with salt and fresh lime or lemon juice to taste. Avocados help the body produce glutathione, which is necessary for the liver to cleanse harmful toxins.\nOption #2: Eat 6-8 ounces of raw organic walnuts. Walnuts contain the amino acid arginine, which is necessary to help the liver detoxify ammonia. Walnuts are also high in glutathione and omega-3 fatty acids which support normal liver detoxification. Make sure you chew the nuts until they are liquefied before swallowing.\nOption #3: Water Meal. If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through the afternoon, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n7:00pm - USP Epsom Salt: Mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom Salt in 8 ounces of warm purified water. Drink it as fast as you can. It is advisable to be near a bathroom when drinking the Epsom Salt as some people experience liquid stools within 20-30 minutes after ingestion.\n8:30pm to 9:00pm: Drink The Olive Oil & Juice: Drink \u00be cup (6 ounces) of organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil. A small amount (2 tablespoons) of freshly squeezed orange, grapefruit, or lemon juice may be added to improve the taste.\nHow to Drink the Olive Oil: It's important to drink all 6 ounces of the olive oil; below are three approaches to help your experience:\nApproach #1: Thicken the oil by refrigeration for a few hours prior to ingestion to make it go down quickly.\nApproach #2: Thin the oil by using a jar to mix \u00bd cup of fresh grapefruit or orange juice into the oil and shake until thin.\r\n\tApproach #3: To reduce the taste and texture, gather two cups, straw, and small amount of juice. Place the olive oil in one cup, juice in the other, and use the straw to alternate drinking between the two.\r\n\tImmediately after drinking the oil, go to bed and lie on your right side with your knees drawn up to your stomach for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, you can stretch out and go to sleep. If you experience cramping, walk around for ten minutes or so and then go back to bed. You may also feel nauseated during the night. This is due to the release of stored toxins from the liver and gallbladder. This is normal and a sign the liver cleanse is working.\nIf you feel the need to vomit, do so as this will help release toxins. If you vomit, this is a sure sign your body is extremely toxic and you should consider repeating the liver cleanse after a five day break. Do not take Oxy-Powder on this night.\nCongratulations! You have just completed your first liver cleanse.What to Expect After the Liver Cleanse\nUpon waking in the morning, immediately take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder. This will help your intestinal tract and body flush the stones released from the liver and gallbladder during the night. For breakfast, eat only fruit. For lunch eat the remaining portion of your liver cleanse soup. For dinner eat a healthy meal such as a salad and some protein.\nIf you would like to see the stones, they should appear in your bowel movements for one to two days. We recommend putting a cheap colander over the toilet to collect the stones and then rinse the fecal matter off in the sink. You will be amazed at what comes out of you.\nRepeat the Liver Cleanse if Necessary\nIf you are still experiencing indications after your third flush, this may be a sign you need additional cleanses. The most we have heard of someone completing is 20 back-to-back liver cleanses before their indications were significantly reduced.\nFrequently Asked Questions:1) Can a liver cleanse be performed if the gallbladder has been removed?Yes!\r\n When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates \r\nfor its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver,\r\n will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some \r\npatients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other \r\ngastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery \r\nsymptoms whatsoever.\u00a0Keeping\r\n the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is\r\n vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are\r\n required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and\r\n the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it \r\neasier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong \r\nbut regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a\r\n liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the \r\nsame effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\u00a03) How will I know when my liver is clean?Everyone\u2019s\r\n results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as \r\nwell as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder \r\nare never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize \r\ntoxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people\r\n require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses\r\n once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is \r\nto judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will \r\nsimply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others \r\nmay take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and \r\nresolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment,\r\n emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to \r\nbe loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the \r\nOxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages \r\nof cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in \r\nfoul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a \r\ntimely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth,\r\n and slick in appearance.4) Will I experience a healing crisis?A\r\n healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during \r\ncleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse \r\nduring and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. \r\nThe accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from \r\nthe body. This process can include physical indications caused by these \r\ntoxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common \r\nindications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental \r\nclarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or \r\nsleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple \r\nindications while others have one or none. These indications will go \r\naway in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, \r\nmany people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense \r\nof well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I \r\nstrongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process \r\nand perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and\r\n drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along\r\n with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and \r\nfar-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\u00a05) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?You\r\n may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a \r\nliver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from \r\nthe Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, \r\nwe do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who \r\ncan assist you more directly with these accommodations.\n"}, {"itemid": "AC-APMICROB-1", "subcat": "Health & Wellness Specials", "name": "Alexapure Breeze Micro Negative Ion Generator", "img": ["alex-pur-thumbnail.png", "alex-pur-thumbnail3.png", "alex-pur-thumbnail2.png"], "price": "$24.95", "desc": " Alexapure Breeze Micro Negative Ion Generator\nThe Alexapure Breeze Micro gives you compact air purification on the go.

In fact, it is essential to have a good balance of friendly bacteria in the gut for optimum health. Labeled by many as the 'good bacteria' in your gut, probiotics are living microorganisms that live in your digestive tract and support good digestive health.\nBiome Defense by Infowars Life is a probiotic and prebiotic supplement that helps populate your digestive tract with a mix of beneficial bacteria to support digestion and boost the immune system.\nMany people consider a daily probiotic to be as important to their health as a multi-vitamin, and for good reason: a healthy body requires a healthy gut!\nThe 7-Year Creation Story of Biome Defense\u2122\nFor years, Alex and Dr. Edward Group have used and recommended multiple different probiotic formulas to help replenish good bacteria in the gut. The problem was, however, that in order to get the quality and potency they wanted, they had to go out and purchase 2, 3, or even 4 different products at a time.\nAnd even then, there were issues with quality, the number of strains in the product, and of course a question of whether or not they were supporting the right companies with their purchases.\nThat's what prompted Dr. Group to begin a seven-year journey to develop the most advanced, all-in-one, full-spectrum, digestive and intestinal health probiotic formula out there*****. \nThis wasn't easy, and it took years to even start sourcing the right ingredients for the groundbreaking formula that would eventually come to be known as Biome Defense\u2122 by Infowars Life.

Your digestive tract is a complex 'machine' that converts nutrients into energy, and supporting your digestive tract is one of the most effective measures you can take to encourage your health.\n\u00a0\n2. Helps Boost the Immune System\nYour gut makes up a very large portion of your immune system, so it should come as no surprise that it is important to start supporting your gut health in order to help boost your immune system.\u00a0 Supporting healthy intestinal epithelium lining integrity, which is the front line for the immune system, is essential for optimal health.\n\u00a0\n3.

What factors negatively affect intestinal flora?\u00a0The gut is a delicate environment that's susceptible to imbalance and can be significantly affected by what you put into your body. Friendly gut bacteria or gut bacteria balance may be negatively impacted by things such as certain unhealthy nutrition choices, prescription medications, and other factors.\n3.

When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates for its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver, will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some patients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other gastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery symptoms whatsoever.\u00a0\nKeeping the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\n\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\n\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it easier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong but regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the same effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3) How will I know when my liver is clean?\nEveryone\u2019s results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as well as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder are never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize toxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is to judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will simply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others may take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and resolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment, emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to be loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the Oxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages of cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in foul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a timely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth, and slick in appearance.\n\u00a0\n4) Will I experience a healing crisis?\nA healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during cleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. This process can include physical indications caused by these toxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common indications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental clarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or sleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple indications while others have one or none. These indications will go away in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, many people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense of well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I strongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process and perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and far-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\n\u00a0\n5) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?\nYou may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a liver cleanse.

The high tannin content of the green hull is primarily responsible for this effect. Other constituents such as juglandin, juglone, and juglandic acid are also involved in the purging process. Research suggests black walnut can oxygenate the blood to create a hostile environment to harmful organisms. The green husk also contains organic iodine, which assists the cleansing of harmful organisms.Organic Epazote (leaves, seed)Rich in ascaridole, epazote is an herb of choice for attacking and expelling various harmful organisms that take up residence in the intestinal tract.Wildcrafted Quassia (bark)The Quassia grows naturally throughout South America and has a particular interesting quality -- no bugs or insects ever bother it. The resin contains a compound known as quasi, which naturally repels insects.Organic Clove (bud)Clove Bud is considered one of the best herbs for killing eggs from harmful organisms and it also discourages fungus.Organic wormwood [Artemisia absinthium] (leaf/stem)Wormwood has been used as an intestinal cleansing herb as far back as 1600BC. Wormwood creates an extremely hostile environment for harmful organisms in your intestinal tract and promotes healthy digestion by increasing liver and gallbladder secretions.Veganzyme\u00ae Blend: (Protease with DPPIV, Amylase, Glucoamalyse, Lactase, Cellulase [I,II], Maltase, Hemicellulase, Xylanase, Beta Glucanase, Serrapeptase, Nattokinase, Bromelain, Papain, alpha Galactosidase, Lipase, Catalase, Invertase, Pectinase, Phytase, Glucose Oxidase)VeganZyme\u00ae is the most advanced, full-spectrum, systemic and digestive enzyme supplement available.

Requiring no electricity, simply pour the water to be purified in the top of the unit and it flows through the ProOne G2.0 filter(s) fully purified and ready for drinking. Once you try it, you will not settle for anything less. The Propur Nomad  gravity fed water filtration system comes with everything you need to get started drinking the best water possible.\u00a0 The system comes standard with:\n\n\n\nYour choice of ProOne G2.0 filter configuration\n\n\nConstructed of heavy duty ONE piece stainless steel\n\n\nAll metal spigot*\n\n\nIncludes a non-slip base pad\n\n\n*The new and improved Propur Solid Stainless Steel Spigot now comes standard.\u00a0 Sleek design, easy to use and install, and built to last.\u00a0 The new built-in stopping points provide precise on and off positions.\u00a0 Also, the special shaped rubber washers are designed to create a tight seal and prevent any leaks.\u00a0 There isn't a better stainless steel spigot in the market and it now comes standard with your purchase of any Propur water filtration unit.About the filter: \u00a0 The key to any water filtration system is the filter.\u00a0 The Propur Nomad comes equipped with your choice of ProOne G2.0 fluoride filter elements which are the result of years of research, design, development and innovation. \u00a0The new ProOne G2.0 Water & Fluoride filter is a two stage filter that combines silver impregnated self-sterilizing white ceramic with new AquaMetix media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, ALL-IN-ONE filter element.\u00a0 No more add-on fluoride filters that slow down flow rate or hang down into the lower clean water reservoir.\u00a0 There is no other filter like this on the market.Scientifically tested by an independent, 3rd party, certified lab:\n\u00a0\nIn addition to primary contaminants such as pathogenic bacteria and cysts, the ProOne G2.0 Water & Fluoride filter elements help reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines (ammonia with chlorine), hydrofluorosilicic acid (the latest form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands) and sodium hexa fluorosilicate.\u00a0 Plus the latest test results show the new ProOne G2.0 Water & Fluoride filter removes glyphosate.\u00a0 More commonly known as Monsanto's Roundup, glyphosate is a very common herbicide used in commercial farming and landscaping.\u00a0 Glyphosate water contamination is increasing due to the wide-spread use of Roundup in GMO crops. \u00a0 Protect you and your family from the many unnatural and harmful chemicals found in your water supply with the ProOne G2.0 Water & Fluoride filter. Easy to install, use and clean - no priming required.\u00a0 The 2.75\" diameter gives you up to 54% more surface area for greater filtration performance compared to other conventional 2\" x 9\" filter elements.\u00a0 The new ProOne G2.0 Water & Fluoride filter elements are tested to meet NSF/ANSI standards 42, 53 and 61.\u00a0 Summary: Gravity filtration is the best way to purify your water.\u00a0 Unlike reverse osmosis or distillation, the Propur filters do not eliminate the beneficial minerals naturally found in water.\u00a0 Reverse osmosis systems also require an ultraviolet (UV) light to kill bacteria such as e-coli and giardia.\u00a0 This makes the reverse osmosis systems harder to maintain, less mobile, and dependent upon an electrical source.\u00a0 Whether for daily use or for emergency preparedness; whether you want to purify river water, well water, pool water, stream water, rainwater, swamp water or simple tap water Propur water purification system is the answer. Propur has taken great care in designing a non-drip spigot and the housing around the filter itself to avoid leakage and defect problems.\u00a0 Like allPropur products, it is backed by their guarantee of customer satisfaction.  **INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS:\u00a0 Please select USPS Priority Mail International to receive correct shipping rate.\u00a0 International orders without this shipping method selected may be delayed or cancelled.\u00a0 You may contact Infowars customer service at 1-888-253-3139 or by email at [email\u00a0protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ if you have any questions.** ***Propur products ship directly from the manufacturer, separate from other Infowars products you may also order.

Try to incorporate the following dietary guidelines to reduce your toxin exposure while cleansing.\n\nTry to purchase organic or locally grown foods as conventional foods are often over-processed, sprayed with pesticides, or grown in nutrient depleted soil.\nTry to include healthy oils in your diet such as coconut, hemp, flax seed, or olive.\nAvoid cow's milk and cheese during the cleanse, instead try almond or hemp milk.\nAvoid foods that contain gluten, such as cereal grains, wheat, barley, white flour, pasta, bread, couscous, flour, tortillas, cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, chips, imitation fish, hot dogs, and fried foods.\nAvoid alcoholic beverages.\nAvoid diet sodas and other products often contain artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame, neotame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Substitute with natural sweeteners such as honey, stevia, or coconut sugar.\nAvoid foods that contain high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, molasses, white sugar, dextrose, sorbitol, processed fructose, and sucrose.\nReplace table salt (sodium chloride) with himalayan salt.\nAvoid soy products. Most soy contains pesticide residue and is genetically modified. Soybeans are also high in phytic acid which is damaging to the digestive tract and blocks the absorption of nutrients and essential minerals.\nCaffeine, in moderation, is acceptable during your cleanse. Try organic tea or coffee without creamers and use natural sweeteners such as raw honey.\n\nWhat To Expect During Your Liver Cleanse\nOxy-Powder can cause watery stools, so make sure a bathroom is nearby. If your stools are liquid, remember this is not diarrhea but the result of turning solid compacted fecal matter in the intestinal tract into a liquid or gas.\nA small percentage of people may experience what is known as a healing crisis. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. Don't get discouraged.\nBefore You Start: Prepare Your Liver Cleanse Formula\nThe night before you start your cleanse, make the following 2 gallons and try to go to bed before 9pm to get a good night's rest.\nHow to Make the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula\n\nMaking Gallon #1: Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula: Pour out 3 ounces from your 1st gallon of distilled or purified water and add all of the Liver Shield formula and 2 tablespoons of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). Shake and refrigerate.\nMaking Gallon #2: Water/Apple Cider Vinegar Mixture (ACV): Pour out 2 ounces from your 2nd gallon of distilled or purified drinking water and add 1 ounce of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar. Shake and refrigerate.\n\nDay 1 - Start Your Liver Cleanse\n\n8:00am: Eat a healthy Breakfast Option (see breakfast diet options from day 1-4). Do not mix the fruits!\n9:00am: Drink one 8-ounce glass of Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n10:00-11:00am: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n12:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n1:00pm: Eat healthy Lunch Meal (see lunch diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your lunch meal.\n3:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n4:00-5:00pm: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n6:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n7:00pm: Eat healthy Dinner Meal (see dinner diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your dinner meal.\n8:00-10:00pm: Before bed, take 4 capsules of Oxy-Powder. Do not go to bed past 10pm!\n\nDays Two, Three, and Four of Your Liver Cleanse\nFollow the same instructions as Day 1, however, from 8:00-10:00pm: take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder.\nDay 5 of Your Liver Cleanse - Flush Day\u009d\n8:00am to 10:00am - Breakfast Meal (see breakfast diet options for day 5). Do not mix the fruits! We recommend using watermelon if it is available due to its high glutathione content.\nAfter breakfast, start preparing your Liver Cleanse Soup for lunch (see the recipe below) if you choose Option #1. Drink the Water/ACV Mixture as needed until lunch.\n12:00pm - Liver Supporting Lunch Meal. Choose from one of the following 3 options for your lunch meal:\nOption #1 - Liver Cleanse Soup (Recommended)\nTo maximize the liver's ability to detox and cleanse, choose a combination of foods which are high in naturally occurring sulphur and glutathione. Sulphur helps the liver cleanse harmful chemicals.\nThe ingredients in the liver cleanse soup include the following:\n\n1 Organic Beet (Washed and Chopped)\n2 Organic Carrots (Chopped)\n1 Cup Broccoli (Chopped)\n10 Organic Garlic Cloves (Minced)\n\u00bd Organic Onion (Chopped)\n\u00bc Organic Lemon\n2 Bay Leaves\n1 Teaspoon Himalayan Crystal Salt\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Turmeric\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Oregano\nOther liver cleansing foods you can use:artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, kale, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower can be added to the soup.\n\nTo prepare the Liver Cleanse Soup: Wash vegetables. Finely chop ingredients to desired consistency. Pour 32 ounces of distilled or purified water into a soup pot. Add all of the ingredients to the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and then simmer on low heat for one hour. Eat this soup for your lunch meal. After your meal, refrigerate the remaining portion of your soup for tomorrow's lunch meal (Day 6).\nOption #2 - Beet/Carrot Juice (Alternate):\n\nPeel and juice ingredients in a blender until desired consistency is achieved.\n3 Organic Carrots (washed and peeled)\n1 Organic Beet (washed and peeled)\n2 Organic Red Apples (washed and cut)\n6 Organic Kale Leaves\n\u00bd Organic Lemon (washed and peeled)\n\u00bd inch Ginger Root\n\nOption 3: (Water/ACV Mixture) - If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through lunch, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n2:00pm - Mid-Afternoon Snack. This will be your last meal of the day. Choose one of the following 3 options:\nOption #1: Organic Avocados, Organic Lime or Lemon, & Himalayan Crystal Salt. Eat 2-3 organic avocados. Season with salt and fresh lime or lemon juice to taste. Avocados help the body produce glutathione, which is necessary for the liver to cleanse harmful toxins.\nOption #2: Eat 6-8 ounces of raw organic walnuts. Walnuts contain the amino acid arginine, which is necessary to help the liver detoxify ammonia. Walnuts are also high in glutathione and omega-3 fatty acids which support normal liver detoxification. Make sure you chew the nuts until they are liquefied before swallowing.\nOption #3: Water Meal. If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through the afternoon, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n7:00pm - USP Epsom Salt: Mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom Salt in 8 ounces of warm purified water. Drink it as fast as you can. It is advisable to be near a bathroom when drinking the Epsom Salt as some people experience liquid stools within 20-30 minutes after ingestion.\n8:30pm to 9:00pm: Drink The Olive Oil & Juice: Drink \u00be cup (6 ounces) of organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil. A small amount (2 tablespoons) of freshly squeezed orange, grapefruit, or lemon juice may be added to improve the taste.\nHow to Drink the Olive Oil: It's important to drink all 6 ounces of the olive oil; below are three approaches to help your experience:\nApproach #1: Thicken the oil by refrigeration for a few hours prior to ingestion to make it go down quickly.\nApproach #2: Thin the oil by using a jar to mix \u00bd cup of fresh grapefruit or orange juice into the oil and shake until thin.\r\n\tApproach #3: To reduce the taste and texture, gather two cups, straw, and small amount of juice. Place the olive oil in one cup, juice in the other, and use the straw to alternate drinking between the two.\r\n\tImmediately after drinking the oil, go to bed and lie on your right side with your knees drawn up to your stomach for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, you can stretch out and go to sleep. If you experience cramping, walk around for ten minutes or so and then go back to bed. You may also feel nauseated during the night. This is due to the release of stored toxins from the liver and gallbladder. This is normal and a sign the liver cleanse is working.\nIf you feel the need to vomit, do so as this will help release toxins. If you vomit, this is a sure sign your body is extremely toxic and you should consider repeating the liver cleanse after a five day break. Do not take Oxy-Powder on this night.\nCongratulations! You have just completed your first liver cleanse.What to Expect After the Liver Cleanse\nUpon waking in the morning, immediately take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder. This will help your intestinal tract and body flush the stones released from the liver and gallbladder during the night. For breakfast, eat only fruit. For lunch eat the remaining portion of your liver cleanse soup. For dinner eat a healthy meal such as a salad and some protein.\nIf you would like to see the stones, they should appear in your bowel movements for one to two days. We recommend putting a cheap colander over the toilet to collect the stones and then rinse the fecal matter off in the sink. You will be amazed at what comes out of you.\nRepeat the Liver Cleanse if Necessary\nIf you are still experiencing indications after your third flush, this may be a sign you need additional cleanses. The most we have heard of someone completing is 20 back-to-back liver cleanses before their indications were significantly reduced.\nFrequently Asked Questions:1) Can a liver cleanse be performed if the gallbladder has been removed?Yes!\r\n When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates \r\nfor its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver,\r\n will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some \r\npatients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other \r\ngastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery \r\nsymptoms whatsoever.\u00a0Keeping\r\n the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is\r\n vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are\r\n required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and\r\n the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it \r\neasier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong \r\nbut regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a\r\n liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the \r\nsame effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\u00a03) How will I know when my liver is clean?Everyone\u2019s\r\n results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as \r\nwell as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder \r\nare never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize \r\ntoxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people\r\n require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses\r\n once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is \r\nto judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will \r\nsimply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others \r\nmay take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and \r\nresolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment,\r\n emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to \r\nbe loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the \r\nOxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages \r\nof cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in \r\nfoul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a \r\ntimely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth,\r\n and slick in appearance.4) Will I experience a healing crisis?A\r\n healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during \r\ncleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse \r\nduring and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. \r\nThe accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from \r\nthe body. This process can include physical indications caused by these \r\ntoxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common \r\nindications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental \r\nclarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or \r\nsleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple \r\nindications while others have one or none. These indications will go \r\naway in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, \r\nmany people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense \r\nof well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I \r\nstrongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process \r\nand perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and\r\n drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along\r\n with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and \r\nfar-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\u00a05) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?You\r\n may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a \r\nliver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from \r\nthe Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, \r\nwe do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who \r\ncan assist you more directly with these accommodations.\n"}, {"itemid": "SP-IWL-ANPLX-10PK", "subcat": "Infowars Life", "name": "Anthroplex 10 Pack", "img": ["anthroplex-10.jpg", "anthroplex-label_1_1.jpg"], "price": "$103.60", "desc": " Introducing Anthroplex, the twice daily pill foundation for men that contains key compounds like horny goat weed, zinc orotate, and a newly balanced blend of hand-selected organic herbs.\n\u00a0\nWhat You've Been Asking For: Anthroplex Is Finally Here\nFor years, listeners have been asking us to add certain ingredients like horny goat weed and zinc orotate to the Super Male Vitality formula, but the years of research and testing put into the precisely balanced Super Male Vitality formula have proven that the exact ratios of the cold pressed organic herbs are essential to maintain.\nThat's why Anthroplex works synergistically with the powerful Super Male Vitality formula in order to help restore your masculine foundation and stimulate vitality with its own blend of unique ingredients.\n\u00a0\nAnthroplex's Unique Formula & Ingredients\n\u00a0\nZinc Orotate\nZinc is an essential dietary mineral that's necessary for proper healthy immune system function, the normal breakdown of food and nutrients, and a number of other processes within the body pertaining to vitality.\n\u00a0\nHorny Goat Weed - Epimedium\nHorny goat weed, or epimedium, is an herb that has been used for ages in Chinese medicine for vitality, and has also been noted for its antioxidant activity.\n\u00a0\nTribulus Terrestris\nTribulus Terrestris has been used in Ayurvedic practice as an herb of choice for vitality, and is noted to contain a compound called protodioscin, which is the putative active component of the herb.\n\u00a0\nTongKat Ali\nAlso known as Malaysian ginseng, TongKat Ali has been traditionally held to support a number of natural functions in men, and was specifically added to the Anthroplex formula using a very specific ingredient ratio.\n\u00a0\nNow Is The Time...\nNow is the time to start fighting back and rebuilding your foundation.

They remain in your digestive system to help boost the growth of beneficial bacteria. Sources of prebiotics include fruits, raw honey, and legumes.\n2. What factors negatively affect intestinal flora?\u00a0The gut is a delicate environment that's susceptible to imbalance and can be significantly affected by what you put into your body. Friendly gut bacteria or gut bacteria balance may be negatively impacted by things such as certain unhealthy nutrition choices, prescription medications, and other factors.\n3.

In fact, it is essential to have a good balance of friendly bacteria in the gut for optimum health. Labeled by many as the 'good bacteria' in your gut, probiotics are living microorganisms that live in your digestive tract and support good digestive health.\nBiome Defense by Infowars Life is a probiotic and prebiotic supplement that helps populate your digestive tract with a mix of beneficial bacteria to support digestion and boost the immune system.\nMany people consider a daily probiotic to be as important to their health as a multi-vitamin, and for good reason: a healthy body requires a healthy gut!\nThe 7-Year Creation Story of Biome Defense\u2122\nFor years, Alex and Dr. Edward Group have used and recommended multiple different probiotic formulas to help replenish good bacteria in the gut. The problem was, however, that in order to get the quality and potency they wanted, they had to go out and purchase 2, 3, or even 4 different products at a time.\nAnd even then, there were issues with quality, the number of strains in the product, and of course a question of whether or not they were supporting the right companies with their purchases.\nThat's what prompted Dr. Group to begin a seven-year journey to develop the most advanced, all-in-one, full-spectrum, digestive and intestinal health probiotic formula out there*****. \nThis wasn't easy, and it took years to even start sourcing the right ingredients for the groundbreaking formula that would eventually come to be known as Biome Defense\u2122 by Infowars Life. One challenge was finding super high quality probiotics created from trustworthy sources. The other challenge was to find a probiotic company that would agree to use our non-toxic, non-GMO certified organic gum acacia, which in itself works as a prebiotic; an innovation that was a world's first in the industry. \nThe world's leading probiotic manufacturers were shocked that Dr. Group refused to settle for cheap probiotic strains with bigger margins. But instead of buckling to industry heads, we are now proud to offer Biome Defense\u2122: a complete prebiotic and probiotic formulation with over 50 billion live and active cultures from 23 probiotic strains. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Top 5 Reasons You Need Biome Defense\n1. Digestive Support\nProbiotics are friendly organisms that help assist the digestive process and encourage proper nutrient absorption. Your digestive tract is a complex 'machine' that converts nutrients into energy, and supporting your digestive tract is one of the most effective measures you can take to encourage your health.\n\u00a0\n2.

It may also  help regenerate the body's natural intracellular antioxidants.The Invention of DNA Force'For years, I'd used many different antioxidants and healthy aging formulas to enhance my own health and that of my patients. However, I always had to use two or three products. I was never able to find a complete, vegan-friendly formula that contained all the cell protecting and healthy aging ingredients. This prompted a lengthy journey to develop the most advanced, all-in-one, full-spectrum, graceful aging, DNA protection, telomere enhancing, antioxidant formula in the world. It is also vegetarian and vegan friendly -- no animal sources. This was no easy task and it took an incredible amount of time to create and source the perfect formula. One challenge I faced was effectively including the top age reducing ingredients into one synergistic blend. In fact, Infowars Life is the first company in the world to offer this unique product containing a blend of the worlds most researched ingredients. When I discussed the formula with the world's leading age reducing scientists, they were shocked. 'Nobody has ever developed a age defying, cell protecting blend like this before. Do you realize it will be one of the most expensive blends ever created to support graceful and healthy aging?' It didn't matter. Unlike other manufacturers whose only concern is low costs and high margins, our number one priority is quality; we produce the best products possible. We're proud to say that the result of those efforts is DNA Force, the most complete, full-spectrum age support product in the world.' \u00a0 -- Dr. Edward F.

When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates for its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver, will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some patients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other gastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery symptoms whatsoever.\u00a0\nKeeping the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\n\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\n\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it easier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong but regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the same effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3) How will I know when my liver is clean?\nEveryone\u2019s results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as well as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder are never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize toxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is to judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will simply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others may take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and resolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment, emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to be loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the Oxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages of cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in foul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a timely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth, and slick in appearance.\n\u00a0\n4) Will I experience a healing crisis?\nA healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during cleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. This process can include physical indications caused by these toxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common indications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental clarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or sleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple indications while others have one or none. These indications will go away in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, many people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense of well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I strongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process and perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and far-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\n\u00a0\n5) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?\nYou may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a liver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from the Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, we do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who can assist you more directly with these accommodations."}, {"itemid": "SP-IWL-LIVSHD-2PK", "subcat": "Infowars Life", "name": "Liver Shield: 2 Pack", "img": ["livershield_2pak.jpg", "livershield_label_2.jpg"], "price": "$103.60", "desc": " \n<!--\r\np.important-info a {\r\nfont-size: 34pt;\r\ntext-decoration: underline;\r\n}\r\n-->\nIs your liver toxic?  \nClick here for the Advanced Liver Cleanse\n  With all of the toxic additives in the food supply, the pharmaceutical drugs in the water, and of course the consumption of alcohol, the answer may be a resounding \u201cYES!\u201d \nThe all-new Infowars Life Liver Shield\u2122\u00a0is a 100% all natural blend of powerful organic and wildcrafted herbs specifically formulated to support natural function and detoxification of the liver and gallbladder.\nThe liver is responsible for over 500 separate functions in the body, and is known to be your primary 'filter' within the body. \nFollowing prolonged toxic buildup, your liver can become full of fatty deposits, built up toxins, and even\u00a0 dangerous objects known as 'liver stones'.

A normal and healthy bowel moves in a timely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth, and slick in appearance.\n\u00a0\n4) Will I experience a healing crisis?\nA healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during cleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. This process can include physical indications caused by these toxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common indications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental clarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or sleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple indications while others have one or none. These indications will go away in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, many people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense of well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I strongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process and perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and far-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\n\u00a0\n5) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?\nYou may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a liver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from the Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, we do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who can assist you more directly with these accommodations."}, {"itemid": "IWL-LIVDEF-1", "subcat": "Infowars Life", "name": "Living Defense", "img": ["livingdefense_single2.jpg", "livingdefenselabelupdate.jpg"], "price": "$44.95", "desc": " Help Eliminate Toxic & Harmful Organisms From Your Body Living Defense\u2122 is a comprehensive blend of all-natural ingredients formulated to promote the cleansing and detoxification of harmful organisms.

The high tannin content of the green hull is primarily responsible for this effect. Other constituents such as juglandin, juglone, and juglandic acid are also involved in the purging process. Research suggests black walnut can oxygenate the blood to create a hostile environment to harmful organisms. The green husk also contains organic iodine, which assists the cleansing of harmful organisms.Organic Epazote (leaves, seed)Rich in ascaridole, epazote is an herb of choice for attacking and expelling various harmful organisms that take up residence in the intestinal tract.Wildcrafted Quassia (bark)The Quassia grows naturally throughout South America and has a particular interesting quality -- no bugs or insects ever bother it. The resin contains a compound known as quasi, which naturally repels insects.Organic Clove (bud)Clove Bud is considered one of the best herbs for killing eggs from harmful organisms and it also discourages fungus.Organic wormwood [Artemisia absinthium] (leaf/stem)Wormwood has been used as an intestinal cleansing herb as far back as 1600BC.

These toxins come from air, food, water, beverages, harmful organisms, stress, radiation and many other potential sources of which many such toxins may end up in the intestinal lining.This led Dr. Group on a journey to create the most powerful oxygen releasing, toxin neutralizing colon cleansing product on the market. It all started by studying the works of the most famous ozone and reactive oxygen species scientists worldwide dating back to the late 1700's. \u00a0With the help of many brilliant scientists and many years of painstaking trial and error, Dr. Group was able to stabilize reactive oxygen species to magnesium compounds, and Oxy-Powder\u00ae was born.

Selenium even plays a role in the natural function of reproductive health, DNA production, and eyesight.\nAs a powerful antioxidant, selenium helps fight free radicals and may even be considered a super antioxidant' because of the way in which it may support other antioxidants.\nOne of its most valuable roles is supporting the natural production of glutathione peroxidase, a key antioxidant enzyme that supports the thyroid and even helps recycle vitamin E and vitamin C into active scavengers of free radicals.\nInfowars Life\u2019s high-potency Bio-True Selenium capsules are made from 100% certified organic mustard seeds and each serving delivers 200 mcg of food-derived, vegan-friendly selenium.\nThe Top 5 Reasons You Need Selenium\n1. A Powerful Antioxidant\nSelenium is an antioxidant that fights free radicals that damage cells and may lead to premature aging. Selenium\u2019s antioxidant status also helps support the immune system naturally.\n2. Healthy Thyroid Support\nMuch like iodine, selenium is important for normal thyroid function. Selenium is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones, and a selenium deficiency can negatively affect healthy hormone balance and normal thyroid function.\n3. Supports Cardiovascular Health\nSelenium plays a notable role in supporting normal cardiovascular health. Selenium can benefit heart health by soothing oxidative stress and supporting normal circulation.\n4. Food-Sourced Formula\nUnlike many selenium formulas out there, Infowars Life Bio-True Selenium\u2122 is never synthetic. It\u2019s a whole food form of selenium extracted from 100% certified organic mustard seed. Each high-potency capsule delivers 200 mcg of highly bioavailable, organically sourced selenium.\n5. Unparalleled Quality\nInfowars Life\u2019s high-potency selenium formula is produced in the USA at a state of the art manufacturing facility equipped with all modern equipment that adheres to cGMP guidelines and has achieved ISO 22000 certification -- the highest in food safety.\nInteresting Facts About Selenium\n\nSelenium concentrations decline with age.\nSelenium is more concentrated in the thyroid than any other area of the body.\nFoods reputed to be good sources of selenium include Brazil Nuts, brewer's yeast, wheat germ, garlic, grains, sunflower seeds, walnuts, raisins, and seafood.\nSoil levels of selenium can vary dramatically from one region to the next.\n\nThe Health Benefits of Selenium\n\nSelenium is one of the body's primary antioxidant enzymes\nSupports normal thyroid and immune function in healthy individuals.\nEncourages normal oxygen levels in the heart.\nSupports healthy bones and joints.\nRequired for the production of prostaglandins that promote healthy blood flow.\nIn synergy with vitamin E, selenium supports energy producing cells.\n\nThe Top 3 Questions People Ask About Selenium\n1. How much selenium is enough? The recommended dietary allowance of selenium for adults can range from 55-200mcg. Adult females may need as little as 55 mcg; adult males as little as 70 mcg; pregnant females at least 65 mcg; and 75 mcg/day for lactating females. For adults, the safe upper limit is 400 mcg/day.\n2. Why is consistent consumption of selenium important? Selenium is a trace mineral and we only need a small amount of it. However, because it plays a role in many important functions, it may get used quickly. A selenium supplement can help ensure regular and consistent availability of this important nutrient.\n3. Why is mustard seed used? Mustard seeds are an excellent, vegan-friendly source of selenium and other nutrients.

Raw elemental iodine is a controlled substance both at a State and Federal level. The licensing, approvals and regulatory documentary procedures are exacting and costly.Bound forms of iodine must first be separated, clarified and purified from other binding components or impurities into a USP-grade (United States Pharmaceutical), mono-elemental iodine as certified USP resublimated iodine crystals. In this purified crystal form, iodine is a highly reactive and toxic substance. However, when the purified USP iodine crystals are subjected to a proprietary process it becomes nano-colloidalized and transforms into a form of elemental nascent iodine, also referred to as monoatomic iodine, without the addition of iodides!Shocking Statistics About Iodine\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization's Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, iodine deficiency is a public health problem in 54 countries.\nThe CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world (Fortunately, it is the easiest to correct).\nThe 2013 USGS iodine commodity summary warns that there are no comparable substitutes for iodine.\nInformation published by UNICEF notes that iodine deficiency is the most avoidable cause of stunted physical and intellectual development.\n\nWhat Are The Health Benefits Of Nascent Iodine?\n\nProper iodine levels may provide support for normal response to environmental and dietary toxins.\nSupports thyroid health.\nMay support breast milk production and quality.\n\nWhy Is Survival Shield X-2 The Best Nascent Iodine Available?\n\nSurvival Shield X-2 is created from salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.\u00a0\nIt is tested for radiation by our quality control experts before being placed for sale.\u00a0\nIt is approximately 50% stronger than our original Survival Shield formulation.\u00a0\nIt is a true glycerite of natural USP grade iodine\nThe nascent iodine in Survival Shield X-2 is not subjected to direct heat, harsh chemicals, or alcohol.\nThe transformative process produces a stable product that no other brand can match!\nCompletely non-GMO certified.\nVegan-friendly and completely non-toxic.\nIt provides high elemental iodine uptake.\nContains NO inefficient iodides.\nDoes not sting or burn.\n\nIMPORTANT SHIPPING INFORMATION:\u00a0International Customers, please check with your country's customs office regarding the import of the products.\u00a0\u00a0As the buyer, you are solely responsible for any import restrictions, prohibited import items, taxes, tariffs, fees and other duties.\u00a0These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.\u00a0\u00a0This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. \u00a0Testimonials represent a cross section of the range of results that appear to be typical with these products.

Water is forced through narrow fibers under high pressure. Clean water exits through tiny pores in the walls of the hollow fibers, but bacteria, viruses, protozoa and other contaminants are trapped inside the hollow fibers and are flushed out by backwashing. This is a highly efficient method of filtration.\n\nThe feed water bucket (2 liter capacity) is filled with water.\nThe 80-micron textile pre-filter (inside the feed water bucket) removes coarser particles and is easy to clean.\nWater passes through the meter-long blue PVC hose and gravity creates sufficient pressure on the membrane cartridge in order to reach a high flow rate.\nUltra filtration takes place in the hollow fiber membrane cartridge - a pore size of 20 nanometers (0.02 microns) retains bacteria, viruses, parasites and fine dirt particles.\nThe blue tap is turned to release purified water.\nBackwash the membrane by squeezing the red backwash bulb 3 times with both taps closed and then releasing the dirty water from the red tap. Water from the red tap should never be consumed.\n\n\n\nThe Science Behind LifeStraw:\nBacked by serious research in our international labs and extensive testing in the field, LifeStraw and LifeStraw Family have been distributed to nearly every major international humanitarian disaster since 2005 and in broad public health campaigns in the millions.\nThe same high-tech design used in places like Haiti, Indonesia, South Africa, Kenya, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and Bangladesh is now available in the USA and Canada.

Since dissolved ionized solids such as salts and minerals increase the conductivity of a solution, a TDS meter measures the conductivity of the solution and estimates the TDS from that. A TDS meter typically displays the TDS in parts per million (ppm). For example, a TDS reading of 1 ppm would indicate there is 1 milligram of dissolved solids in each kilogram of water. TDS is a measure of total dissolved solids and NOT dissolved contaminants. A higher TDS can simply be high calcium or mineral content. As Propur filters are made from minerals, TDS may be higher after the water has been treated. This does not mean the filter isn't working, it means the TDS meter is picking up the minerals that are naturally released by the filter. A PPM meter is the same as a TDS meter, it is simply measures dissolved solids in water. A TDS meter is not generally recognized in the industry as a proper means of testing water for contaminants. They were created years ago by the manufacturers of reverse osmosis systems as a means of demonstrating the effectiveness of RO which removes most if not all minerals.\"*The removal/reduction of contaminants or other substances, filter replacement period and/or life expectancy in gallons may vary depending on the level of contaminants present in your water supply. Some contaminants may be more easily filtered than others.

There is no other filter like this on the market.

Easy to install, use and clean - no priming required.\u00a0 The 2.75\" diameter gives you up to 54% more surface area for greater filtration performance compared to other conventional 2\" x 9\" filter elements.\u00a0 The new ProOne G2.0 Water & Fluoride filter elements are tested to meet NSF/ANSI standards 42, 53 and 61.\u00a0 Visit the ProOne G2.0 Technical Information Page for further information.Summary: Gravity filtration is the best way to purify your water.\u00a0 Unlike reverse osmosis or distillation, the Propur filters do not eliminate the beneficial minerals naturally found in water.\u00a0 Reverse osmosis systems also require an ultraviolet (UV) light to kill bacteria such as e-coli and giardia.\u00a0 This makes the reverse osmosis systems harder to maintain, less mobile, and dependent upon an electrical source.\u00a0 Whether for daily use or for emergency preparedness; whether you want to purify river water, well water, pool water, stream water, rainwater, swamp water or simple tap water Propur water purification system is the answer. Propur has taken great care in designing a non-drip spigot and the housing around the filter itself to avoid leakage and defect problems.\u00a0 Like allPropur products, it is backed by their guarantee of customer satisfaction. **INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS:\u00a0 Please select USPS Priority Mail International to receive correct shipping rate.\u00a0 International orders without this shipping method selected may be delayed or cancelled.\u00a0 You may contact Infowars customer service at 1-888-253-3139 or by email at [email\u00a0protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ if you have any questions.** ***Propur products ship directly from the manufacturer, separate from other Infowars products you may also order.

Try to incorporate the following dietary guidelines to reduce your toxin exposure while cleansing.\n\nTry to purchase organic or locally grown foods as conventional foods are often over-processed, sprayed with pesticides, or grown in nutrient depleted soil.\nTry to include healthy oils in your diet such as coconut, hemp, flax seed, or olive.\nAvoid cow's milk and cheese during the cleanse, instead try almond or hemp milk.\nAvoid foods that contain gluten, such as cereal grains, wheat, barley, white flour, pasta, bread, couscous, flour, tortillas, cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, chips, imitation fish, hot dogs, and fried foods.\nAvoid alcoholic beverages.\nAvoid diet sodas and other products often contain artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame, neotame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Substitute with natural sweeteners such as honey, stevia, or coconut sugar.\nAvoid foods that contain high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, molasses, white sugar, dextrose, sorbitol, processed fructose, and sucrose.\nReplace table salt (sodium chloride) with himalayan salt.\nAvoid soy products. Most soy contains pesticide residue and is genetically modified. Soybeans are also high in phytic acid which is damaging to the digestive tract and blocks the absorption of nutrients and essential minerals.\nCaffeine, in moderation, is acceptable during your cleanse. Try organic tea or coffee without creamers and use natural sweeteners such as raw honey.\n\nWhat To Expect During Your Liver Cleanse\nOxy-Powder can cause watery stools, so make sure a bathroom is nearby. If your stools are liquid, remember this is not diarrhea but the result of turning solid compacted fecal matter in the intestinal tract into a liquid or gas.\nA small percentage of people may experience what is known as a healing crisis. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. Don't get discouraged.\nBefore You Start: Prepare Your Liver Cleanse Formula\nThe night before you start your cleanse, make the following 2 gallons and try to go to bed before 9pm to get a good night's rest.\nHow to Make the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula\n\nMaking Gallon #1: Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula: Pour out 3 ounces from your 1st gallon of distilled or purified water and add all of the Liver Shield formula and 2 tablespoons of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). Shake and refrigerate.\nMaking Gallon #2: Water/Apple Cider Vinegar Mixture (ACV): Pour out 2 ounces from your 2nd gallon of distilled or purified drinking water and add 1 ounce of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar. Shake and refrigerate.\n\nDay 1 - Start Your Liver Cleanse\n\n8:00am: Eat a healthy Breakfast Option (see breakfast diet options from day 1-4). Do not mix the fruits!\n9:00am: Drink one 8-ounce glass of Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n10:00-11:00am: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n12:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n1:00pm: Eat healthy Lunch Meal (see lunch diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your lunch meal.\n3:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n4:00-5:00pm: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n6:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n7:00pm: Eat healthy Dinner Meal (see dinner diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your dinner meal.\n8:00-10:00pm: Before bed, take 4 capsules of Oxy-Powder. Do not go to bed past 10pm!\n\nDays Two, Three, and Four of Your Liver Cleanse\nFollow the same instructions as Day 1, however, from 8:00-10:00pm: take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder.\nDay 5 of Your Liver Cleanse - Flush Day\u009d\n8:00am to 10:00am - Breakfast Meal (see breakfast diet options for day 5). Do not mix the fruits! We recommend using watermelon if it is available due to its high glutathione content.\nAfter breakfast, start preparing your Liver Cleanse Soup for lunch (see the recipe below) if you choose Option #1. Drink the Water/ACV Mixture as needed until lunch.\n12:00pm - Liver Supporting Lunch Meal. Choose from one of the following 3 options for your lunch meal:\nOption #1 - Liver Cleanse Soup (Recommended)\nTo maximize the liver's ability to detox and cleanse, choose a combination of foods which are high in naturally occurring sulphur and glutathione. Sulphur helps the liver cleanse harmful chemicals.\nThe ingredients in the liver cleanse soup include the following:\n\n1 Organic Beet (Washed and Chopped)\n2 Organic Carrots (Chopped)\n1 Cup Broccoli (Chopped)\n10 Organic Garlic Cloves (Minced)\n\u00bd Organic Onion (Chopped)\n\u00bc Organic Lemon\n2 Bay Leaves\n1 Teaspoon Himalayan Crystal Salt\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Turmeric\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Oregano\nOther liver cleansing foods you can use:artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, kale, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower can be added to the soup.\n\nTo prepare the Liver Cleanse Soup: Wash vegetables. Finely chop ingredients to desired consistency. Pour 32 ounces of distilled or purified water into a soup pot. Add all of the ingredients to the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and then simmer on low heat for one hour. Eat this soup for your lunch meal. After your meal, refrigerate the remaining portion of your soup for tomorrow's lunch meal (Day 6).\nOption #2 - Beet/Carrot Juice (Alternate):\n\nPeel and juice ingredients in a blender until desired consistency is achieved.\n3 Organic Carrots (washed and peeled)\n1 Organic Beet (washed and peeled)\n2 Organic Red Apples (washed and cut)\n6 Organic Kale Leaves\n\u00bd Organic Lemon (washed and peeled)\n\u00bd inch Ginger Root\n\nOption 3: (Water/ACV Mixture) - If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through lunch, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n2:00pm - Mid-Afternoon Snack. This will be your last meal of the day. Choose one of the following 3 options:\nOption #1: Organic Avocados, Organic Lime or Lemon, & Himalayan Crystal Salt. Eat 2-3 organic avocados. Season with salt and fresh lime or lemon juice to taste. Avocados help the body produce glutathione, which is necessary for the liver to cleanse harmful toxins.\nOption #2: Eat 6-8 ounces of raw organic walnuts. Walnuts contain the amino acid arginine, which is necessary to help the liver detoxify ammonia. Walnuts are also high in glutathione and omega-3 fatty acids which support normal liver detoxification. Make sure you chew the nuts until they are liquefied before swallowing.\nOption #3: Water Meal. If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through the afternoon, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n7:00pm - USP Epsom Salt: Mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom Salt in 8 ounces of warm purified water. Drink it as fast as you can. It is advisable to be near a bathroom when drinking the Epsom Salt as some people experience liquid stools within 20-30 minutes after ingestion.\n8:30pm to 9:00pm: Drink The Olive Oil & Juice: Drink \u00be cup (6 ounces) of organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil. A small amount (2 tablespoons) of freshly squeezed orange, grapefruit, or lemon juice may be added to improve the taste.\nHow to Drink the Olive Oil: It's important to drink all 6 ounces of the olive oil; below are three approaches to help your experience:\nApproach #1: Thicken the oil by refrigeration for a few hours prior to ingestion to make it go down quickly.\nApproach #2: Thin the oil by using a jar to mix \u00bd cup of fresh grapefruit or orange juice into the oil and shake until thin.\r\n\tApproach #3: To reduce the taste and texture, gather two cups, straw, and small amount of juice. Place the olive oil in one cup, juice in the other, and use the straw to alternate drinking between the two.\r\n\tImmediately after drinking the oil, go to bed and lie on your right side with your knees drawn up to your stomach for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, you can stretch out and go to sleep. If you experience cramping, walk around for ten minutes or so and then go back to bed. You may also feel nauseated during the night. This is due to the release of stored toxins from the liver and gallbladder. This is normal and a sign the liver cleanse is working.\nIf you feel the need to vomit, do so as this will help release toxins. If you vomit, this is a sure sign your body is extremely toxic and you should consider repeating the liver cleanse after a five day break. Do not take Oxy-Powder on this night.\nCongratulations! You have just completed your first liver cleanse.What to Expect After the Liver Cleanse\nUpon waking in the morning, immediately take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder. This will help your intestinal tract and body flush the stones released from the liver and gallbladder during the night. For breakfast, eat only fruit. For lunch eat the remaining portion of your liver cleanse soup. For dinner eat a healthy meal such as a salad and some protein.\nIf you would like to see the stones, they should appear in your bowel movements for one to two days. We recommend putting a cheap colander over the toilet to collect the stones and then rinse the fecal matter off in the sink. You will be amazed at what comes out of you.\nRepeat the Liver Cleanse if Necessary\nIf you are still experiencing indications after your third flush, this may be a sign you need additional cleanses. The most we have heard of someone completing is 20 back-to-back liver cleanses before their indications were significantly reduced.\nFrequently Asked Questions:1) Can a liver cleanse be performed if the gallbladder has been removed?Yes!\r\n When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates \r\nfor its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver,\r\n will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some \r\npatients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other \r\ngastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery \r\nsymptoms whatsoever.\u00a0Keeping\r\n the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is\r\n vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are\r\n required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and\r\n the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it \r\neasier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong \r\nbut regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a\r\n liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the \r\nsame effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\u00a03) How will I know when my liver is clean?Everyone\u2019s\r\n results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as \r\nwell as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder \r\nare never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize \r\ntoxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people\r\n require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses\r\n once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is \r\nto judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will \r\nsimply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others \r\nmay take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and \r\nresolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment,\r\n emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to \r\nbe loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the \r\nOxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages \r\nof cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in \r\nfoul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a \r\ntimely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth,\r\n and slick in appearance.4) Will I experience a healing crisis?A\r\n healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during \r\ncleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse \r\nduring and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. \r\nThe accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from \r\nthe body. This process can include physical indications caused by these \r\ntoxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common \r\nindications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental \r\nclarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or \r\nsleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple \r\nindications while others have one or none. These indications will go \r\naway in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, \r\nmany people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense \r\nof well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I \r\nstrongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process \r\nand perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and\r\n drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along\r\n with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and \r\nfar-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\u00a05) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?You\r\n may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a \r\nliver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from \r\nthe Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, \r\nwe do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who \r\ncan assist you more directly with these accommodations.\n"}, {"itemid": "AC-APMICROB-1", "subcat": "Wellness", "name": "Alexapure Breeze Micro Negative Ion Generator", "img": ["alex-pur-thumbnail.png", "alex-pur-thumbnail3.png", "alex-pur-thumbnail2.png"], "price": "$24.95", "desc": " Alexapure Breeze Micro Negative Ion Generator\nThe Alexapure Breeze Micro gives you compact air purification on the go.

When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates for its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver, will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some patients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other gastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery symptoms whatsoever.\u00a0\nKeeping the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\n\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\n\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it easier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong but regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the same effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3) How will I know when my liver is clean?\nEveryone\u2019s results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as well as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder are never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize toxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is to judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will simply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others may take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and resolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment, emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to be loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the Oxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages of cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in foul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a timely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth, and slick in appearance.\n\u00a0\n4) Will I experience a healing crisis?\nA healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during cleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. This process can include physical indications caused by these toxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common indications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental clarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or sleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple indications while others have one or none. These indications will go away in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, many people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense of well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I strongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process and perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and far-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\n\u00a0\n5) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?\nYou may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a liver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from the Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, we do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who can assist you more directly with these accommodations."}, {"itemid": "AC-MOD-PS-1", "subcat": "Wellness", "name": "Modifilan", "img": ["modifilan_capsules.jpg"], "price": "$103.60", "desc": " Modifilan is a natural dietary supplement created from concentrated Laminaria Japonica brown seaweed extract.\u00a0\u00a0 It is a natural food supplement which contains several beneficial organic elements.\u00a0 One of the main qualities of Laminaria is its high content of alginates, which are enhanced by the extraction process used to produce Modifilan.Modifilan is a whole food.

These toxins come from air, food, water, beverages, harmful organisms, stress, radiation and many other potential sources of which many such toxins may end up in the intestinal lining.This led Dr. Group on a journey to create the most powerful oxygen releasing, toxin neutralizing colon cleansing product on the market. It all started by studying the works of the most famous ozone and reactive oxygen species scientists worldwide dating back to the late 1700's. \u00a0With the help of many brilliant scientists and many years of painstaking trial and error, Dr. Group was able to stabilize reactive oxygen species to magnesium compounds, and Oxy-Powder\u00ae was born.

To assist the  cleansing process, it's advised to drink half of your body weight in  ounces of purified water daily while taking Oxy-Powder\u00ae even though  there has never been a documented case of dehydration or electrolyte  imbalance. To figure out your body weight in ounces, please divide your  body weight in half.

It all started by studying a combination of herbs that have been traditionally understood to enhance and regulate the body as well as the works of the most famous 16th century healer, scientist and formulator,\u00a0Paracelsus.\nParacelsus originally composed the word Spagyria (Spagyry), which means to extract (spao) and combine (ageiro). The word was used to describe the process and power of turning a preparation of herbs into a liquid formula dedicated to enhancing health. \nThis original technology was taken and advanced by using the science of modern day technology.\nThe Spagyrex process used in Infowars Life products combines ancient and current technologies to create a revolutionary, multi-step, proprietary herbal formula technique that does not chemically change the natural ingredients. This follows the principle of separating and recombining all the elements of an herb, to extract the most powerful essence of its healing nature. \nSuper Male Vitality Ingredients:\nPlease note: while these Asian and South American herbs have been available individually in specialty herb shops in the United States for decades, we have brought them together in a unique combination for you.\nTribulus terrestris (fruit)\nTribulus terrestris is a vigorous plant integrated into the Super Male Vitality.\u00a0 Numerous benefits regarding vitality are attributed to the plant by men worldwide. \nSuma (root)\nSuma is a ground vine with deep roots.

Maca was made popular by indigenous tribes in Peru who have used the root for purposes of vitality for quite some time.\nAvena sativa (root)\nAlso known as the common oat, avena sativa contains natural compounds that may help support normal response in men.\nTongkat ali (root)\nTongkat ali, or Malaysian ginseng, is traditionally held to support a number of natural functions in men.\nCatuaba (bark)\nNative to the Amazon, catuaba is a small, flowering tree.

The Top 5 Reasons You Need Nascent Iodine \n\nIodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health and well-being.\u00a0 \nNascent iodine may support healthy iodine levels.\u00a0 \nNascent iodine may support healthy hormone levels.\u00a0 \nNascent iodine may be involved in maintaining healthy metabolism.\nSupplementing with pure nascent iodine may provide sufficient iodine so that the body does not need to absorb iodine from other, perhaps less pure, sources.\n\nSurvival Shield X-2 QualitySurvival Shield X-2 is manufactured in a state-licensed facility that meets federal regulatory standards, is cGMP/HACCP-compliant, and lab grade. Raw elemental iodine is a controlled substance both at a State and Federal level. The licensing, approvals and regulatory documentary procedures are exacting and costly.Bound forms of iodine must first be separated, clarified and purified from other binding components or impurities into a USP-grade (United States Pharmaceutical), mono-elemental iodine as certified USP resublimated iodine crystals. In this purified crystal form, iodine is a highly reactive and toxic substance. However, when the purified USP iodine crystals are subjected to a proprietary process it becomes nano-colloidalized and transforms into a form of elemental nascent iodine, also referred to as monoatomic iodine, without the addition of iodides!Shocking Statistics About Iodine\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization's Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, iodine deficiency is a public health problem in 54 countries.\nThe CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world (Fortunately, it is the easiest to correct).\nThe 2013 USGS iodine commodity summary warns that there are no comparable substitutes for iodine.\nInformation published by UNICEF notes that iodine deficiency is the most avoidable cause of stunted physical and intellectual development.\n\nWhat Are The Health Benefits Of Nascent Iodine?\n\nProper iodine levels may provide support for normal response to environmental and dietary toxins.\nSupports thyroid health.\nMay support breast milk production and quality.\n\n Why Is Survival Shield X-2 The Best Nascent Iodine Available?\n\nSurvival Shield X-2 is created from salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface. \nIt is tested for radiation by our quality control experts before being placed for sale. \nIt is approximately 50% stronger than our original Survival Shield formulation. \nIt is a true glycerite of natural USP grade iodine\nThe nascent iodine in Survival Shield X-2 is not subjected to direct heat, harsh chemicals, or alcohol.\nThe transformative process produces a stable product that no other brand can match!\nCompletely non-GMO certified.\nVegan-friendly and completely non-toxic.\nIt provides high elemental iodine uptake.\nContains NO inefficient iodides.\nDoes not sting or burn.\n\nIMPORTANT SHIPPING INFORMATION:\u00a0International Customers, please check with your country's customs office regarding the import of the products.\u00a0 As the buyer, you are solely responsible for any import restrictions, prohibited import items, taxes, tariffs, fees and other duties.\nSurvival Shield X-2 now ships from a separate warehouse via USPS.

We simply could not have launched any of our  operations without you.For more than a decade, my favorite  coffee has come from the high mountains of Southern Mexico, where the  Chiapas farmers grow their unique coffee beans. We have now managed to  secure these unique beans in my favorite coffee \uff96 the new Patriot Blend  100% organic coffee. The key to why this blend is my favorite is  rooted in the way that it has a highly robust and enjoyable taste that  at the same time is not too acidic and goes down extremely smooth. And  perhaps even more important than the great taste is the fact that when  drinking the Patriot Blend coffee, I do not experience the headaches and  other negative effects that are usually associated with caffeinated  coffee blends.This is my favorite coffee, and it has taken  years to secure a connection directly to the Chiapas farmers co-op that  actually financially aids these indigenous individuals. This coffee is  really going beyond Fair Trade in aiding these farmers, and at the same  time is 100% certified organic and tastes great.

Try to incorporate the following dietary guidelines to reduce your toxin exposure while cleansing.\n\nTry to purchase organic or locally grown foods as conventional foods are often over-processed, sprayed with pesticides, or grown in nutrient depleted soil.\nTry to include healthy oils in your diet such as coconut, hemp, flax seed, or olive.\nAvoid cow's milk and cheese during the cleanse, instead try almond or hemp milk.\nAvoid foods that contain gluten, such as cereal grains, wheat, barley, white flour, pasta, bread, couscous, flour, tortillas, cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, chips, imitation fish, hot dogs, and fried foods.\nAvoid alcoholic beverages.\nAvoid diet sodas and other products often contain artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame, neotame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Substitute with natural sweeteners such as honey, stevia, or coconut sugar.\nAvoid foods that contain high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, molasses, white sugar, dextrose, sorbitol, processed fructose, and sucrose.\nReplace table salt (sodium chloride) with himalayan salt.\nAvoid soy products. Most soy contains pesticide residue and is genetically modified. Soybeans are also high in phytic acid which is damaging to the digestive tract and blocks the absorption of nutrients and essential minerals.\nCaffeine, in moderation, is acceptable during your cleanse. Try organic tea or coffee without creamers and use natural sweeteners such as raw honey.\n\nWhat To Expect During Your Liver Cleanse\nOxy-Powder can cause watery stools, so make sure a bathroom is nearby. If your stools are liquid, remember this is not diarrhea but the result of turning solid compacted fecal matter in the intestinal tract into a liquid or gas.\nA small percentage of people may experience what is known as a healing crisis. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. Don't get discouraged.\nBefore You Start: Prepare Your Liver Cleanse Formula\nThe night before you start your cleanse, make the following 2 gallons and try to go to bed before 9pm to get a good night's rest.\nHow to Make the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula\n\nMaking Gallon #1: Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula: Pour out 3 ounces from your 1st gallon of distilled or purified water and add all of the Liver Shield formula and 2 tablespoons of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). Shake and refrigerate.\nMaking Gallon #2: Water/Apple Cider Vinegar Mixture (ACV): Pour out 2 ounces from your 2nd gallon of distilled or purified drinking water and add 1 ounce of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar. Shake and refrigerate.\n\nDay 1 - Start Your Liver Cleanse\n\n8:00am: Eat a healthy Breakfast Option (see breakfast diet options from day 1-4). Do not mix the fruits!\n9:00am: Drink one 8-ounce glass of Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n10:00-11:00am: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n12:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n1:00pm: Eat healthy Lunch Meal (see lunch diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your lunch meal.\n3:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n4:00-5:00pm: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n6:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n7:00pm: Eat healthy Dinner Meal (see dinner diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your dinner meal.\n8:00-10:00pm: Before bed, take 4 capsules of Oxy-Powder. Do not go to bed past 10pm!\n\nDays Two, Three, and Four of Your Liver Cleanse\nFollow the same instructions as Day 1, however, from 8:00-10:00pm: take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder.\nDay 5 of Your Liver Cleanse - Flush Day\u009d\n8:00am to 10:00am - Breakfast Meal (see breakfast diet options for day 5). Do not mix the fruits! We recommend using watermelon if it is available due to its high glutathione content.\nAfter breakfast, start preparing your Liver Cleanse Soup for lunch (see the recipe below) if you choose Option #1. Drink the Water/ACV Mixture as needed until lunch.\n12:00pm - Liver Supporting Lunch Meal. Choose from one of the following 3 options for your lunch meal:\nOption #1 - Liver Cleanse Soup (Recommended)\nTo maximize the liver's ability to detox and cleanse, choose a combination of foods which are high in naturally occurring sulphur and glutathione. Sulphur helps the liver cleanse harmful chemicals.\nThe ingredients in the liver cleanse soup include the following:\n\n1 Organic Beet (Washed and Chopped)\n2 Organic Carrots (Chopped)\n1 Cup Broccoli (Chopped)\n10 Organic Garlic Cloves (Minced)\n\u00bd Organic Onion (Chopped)\n\u00bc Organic Lemon\n2 Bay Leaves\n1 Teaspoon Himalayan Crystal Salt\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Turmeric\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Oregano\nOther liver cleansing foods you can use:artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, kale, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower can be added to the soup.\n\nTo prepare the Liver Cleanse Soup: Wash vegetables. Finely chop ingredients to desired consistency. Pour 32 ounces of distilled or purified water into a soup pot. Add all of the ingredients to the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and then simmer on low heat for one hour. Eat this soup for your lunch meal. After your meal, refrigerate the remaining portion of your soup for tomorrow's lunch meal (Day 6).\nOption #2 - Beet/Carrot Juice (Alternate):\n\nPeel and juice ingredients in a blender until desired consistency is achieved.\n3 Organic Carrots (washed and peeled)\n1 Organic Beet (washed and peeled)\n2 Organic Red Apples (washed and cut)\n6 Organic Kale Leaves\n\u00bd Organic Lemon (washed and peeled)\n\u00bd inch Ginger Root\n\nOption 3: (Water/ACV Mixture) - If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through lunch, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n2:00pm - Mid-Afternoon Snack. This will be your last meal of the day. Choose one of the following 3 options:\nOption #1: Organic Avocados, Organic Lime or Lemon, & Himalayan Crystal Salt. Eat 2-3 organic avocados. Season with salt and fresh lime or lemon juice to taste. Avocados help the body produce glutathione, which is necessary for the liver to cleanse harmful toxins.\nOption #2: Eat 6-8 ounces of raw organic walnuts. Walnuts contain the amino acid arginine, which is necessary to help the liver detoxify ammonia. Walnuts are also high in glutathione and omega-3 fatty acids which support normal liver detoxification. Make sure you chew the nuts until they are liquefied before swallowing.\nOption #3: Water Meal. If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through the afternoon, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n7:00pm - USP Epsom Salt: Mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom Salt in 8 ounces of warm purified water. Drink it as fast as you can. It is advisable to be near a bathroom when drinking the Epsom Salt as some people experience liquid stools within 20-30 minutes after ingestion.\n8:30pm to 9:00pm: Drink The Olive Oil & Juice: Drink \u00be cup (6 ounces) of organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil. A small amount (2 tablespoons) of freshly squeezed orange, grapefruit, or lemon juice may be added to improve the taste.\nHow to Drink the Olive Oil: It's important to drink all 6 ounces of the olive oil; below are three approaches to help your experience:\nApproach #1: Thicken the oil by refrigeration for a few hours prior to ingestion to make it go down quickly.\nApproach #2: Thin the oil by using a jar to mix \u00bd cup of fresh grapefruit or orange juice into the oil and shake until thin.\r\n\tApproach #3: To reduce the taste and texture, gather two cups, straw, and small amount of juice. Place the olive oil in one cup, juice in the other, and use the straw to alternate drinking between the two.\r\n\tImmediately after drinking the oil, go to bed and lie on your right side with your knees drawn up to your stomach for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, you can stretch out and go to sleep. If you experience cramping, walk around for ten minutes or so and then go back to bed. You may also feel nauseated during the night. This is due to the release of stored toxins from the liver and gallbladder. This is normal and a sign the liver cleanse is working.\nIf you feel the need to vomit, do so as this will help release toxins. If you vomit, this is a sure sign your body is extremely toxic and you should consider repeating the liver cleanse after a five day break. Do not take Oxy-Powder on this night.\nCongratulations! You have just completed your first liver cleanse.What to Expect After the Liver Cleanse\nUpon waking in the morning, immediately take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder. This will help your intestinal tract and body flush the stones released from the liver and gallbladder during the night. For breakfast, eat only fruit. For lunch eat the remaining portion of your liver cleanse soup. For dinner eat a healthy meal such as a salad and some protein.\nIf you would like to see the stones, they should appear in your bowel movements for one to two days. We recommend putting a cheap colander over the toilet to collect the stones and then rinse the fecal matter off in the sink. You will be amazed at what comes out of you.\nRepeat the Liver Cleanse if Necessary\nIf you are still experiencing indications after your third flush, this may be a sign you need additional cleanses. The most we have heard of someone completing is 20 back-to-back liver cleanses before their indications were significantly reduced.\nFrequently Asked Questions:1) Can a liver cleanse be performed if the gallbladder has been removed?Yes!\r\n When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates \r\nfor its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver,\r\n will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some \r\npatients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other \r\ngastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery \r\nsymptoms whatsoever.\u00a0Keeping\r\n the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is\r\n vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are\r\n required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and\r\n the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it \r\neasier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong \r\nbut regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a\r\n liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the \r\nsame effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\u00a03) How will I know when my liver is clean?Everyone\u2019s\r\n results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as \r\nwell as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder \r\nare never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize \r\ntoxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people\r\n require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses\r\n once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is \r\nto judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will \r\nsimply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others \r\nmay take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and \r\nresolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment,\r\n emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to \r\nbe loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the \r\nOxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages \r\nof cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in \r\nfoul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a \r\ntimely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth,\r\n and slick in appearance.4) Will I experience a healing crisis?A\r\n healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during \r\ncleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse \r\nduring and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. \r\nThe accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from \r\nthe body. This process can include physical indications caused by these \r\ntoxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common \r\nindications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental \r\nclarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or \r\nsleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple \r\nindications while others have one or none. These indications will go \r\naway in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, \r\nmany people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense \r\nof well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I \r\nstrongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process \r\nand perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and\r\n drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along\r\n with plenty of rest may help you to feel better.

In fact, it is essential to have a good balance of friendly bacteria in the gut for optimum health. Labeled by many as the 'good bacteria' in your gut, probiotics are living microorganisms that live in your digestive tract and support good digestive health.\nBiome Defense by Infowars Life is a probiotic and prebiotic supplement that helps populate your digestive tract with a mix of beneficial bacteria to support digestion and boost the immune system.\nMany people consider a daily probiotic to be as important to their health as a multi-vitamin, and for good reason: a healthy body requires a healthy gut!\nThe 7-Year Creation Story of Biome Defense\u2122\nFor years, Alex and Dr. Edward Group have used and recommended multiple different probiotic formulas to help replenish good bacteria in the gut. The problem was, however, that in order to get the quality and potency they wanted, they had to go out and purchase 2, 3, or even 4 different products at a time.\nAnd even then, there were issues with quality, the number of strains in the product, and of course a question of whether or not they were supporting the right companies with their purchases.\nThat's what prompted Dr. Group to begin a seven-year journey to develop the most advanced, all-in-one, full-spectrum, digestive and intestinal health probiotic formula out there*****. \nThis wasn't easy, and it took years to even start sourcing the right ingredients for the groundbreaking formula that would eventually come to be known as Biome Defense\u2122 by Infowars Life. One challenge was finding super high quality probiotics created from trustworthy sources. The other challenge was to find a probiotic company that would agree to use our non-toxic, non-GMO certified organic gum acacia, which in itself works as a prebiotic; an innovation that was a world's first in the industry. \nThe world's leading probiotic manufacturers were shocked that Dr. Group refused to settle for cheap probiotic strains with bigger margins.

Digestive Support\nProbiotics are friendly organisms that help assist the digestive process and encourage proper nutrient absorption. Your digestive tract is a complex 'machine' that converts nutrients into energy, and supporting your digestive tract is one of the most effective measures you can take to encourage your health.\n\u00a0\n2. Helps Boost the Immune System\nYour gut makes up a very large portion of your immune system, so it should come as no surprise that it is important to start supporting your gut health in order to help boost your immune system.\u00a0 Supporting healthy intestinal epithelium lining integrity, which is the front line for the immune system, is essential for optimal health.\n\u00a0\n3. Promotes Internal Balance\nYour gut is home to over 500 types of bacteria -- some of them are good, some of them are bad. A daily probiotic supplement like Biome Defense\u2122\u00a0 helps promote the growth of good bacteria to help 'balance out' the bad. Biome Defense\u2122 can be a key part of your all natural solutions for replenishing your gut's supply of good bacteria and keeping harmful organisms at bay.\n4.

What factors negatively affect intestinal flora?\u00a0The gut is a delicate environment that's susceptible to imbalance and can be significantly affected by what you put into your body. Friendly gut bacteria or gut bacteria balance may be negatively impacted by things such as certain unhealthy nutrition choices, prescription medications, and other factors.\n3. What does CFU mean?\u00a0Colony forming units are how probiotics are measured, generally measured in the millions or billions per serving.

These stones build up in your liver when excess lipids start to crystallize, turning into pebble-sized stones. \nA healthy liver helps with digestion, energy levels, body detoxification, and so many other important functions\n\u00a0\nOur Proprietary Process Based on Powerful Organic Herbs\nThat's why I'm excited to announce that Liver Shield\u2122\u00a0is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spagyrex\u00ae\u00a0 blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification. \nAs always, Liver Shield\u2122\u00a0also follows the highest quality standards for nutraceutical grade manufacturing. \nLiver Shield\u2122is:\n\n100% true alcohol free.\nVegan Safe and GMO Free.\nKosher, Halal and Vegan Safe.\nMade with organic and wild cultivated herbs.\nMade in the USA using Eco-friendly sustainable manufacturing.\nNever tested on animals.\n\nShocking Stats About Liver Health\n\nAccording to the National Center for Health Statistics, chronic liver diseases are among the most common causes of death in the United States.\nAlmost\u00a026,000 people in the US die each year from cirrhosis, The American Liver Foundation warns that alcohol abuse contributes to most incidences of cirrhosis.\nUp to 20% of the population has liver stones and gallstones.\nA poor diet is a major contributor to most liver problems and toxic buildup.\nMore than 900 prescription drugs can injure the liver and 80% of all cases of liver toxicity are caused by drug reactions.\n29 million Americans have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\n90% of heavy alcohol drinkers develop fatty liver disease.\u00a0\n6,000 - 10,000 liver transplants are performed yearly in the United States.\n\nHow to Use Liver Shield\u2122 \nFor General Liver Support\nMix 2 full droppers with 4 ounces purified water and drink before breakfast 2 to 3 times weekly.\nThe 6 Day Advanced Liver Cleanse\nTo view full instructions, click here.\nTry The Infowars Life Liver Shield\u2122 Today\nOur Infowars Life Liver Shield\u2122 is easy to take, made in the USA, and helps support the message of truth and liberty.

When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates for its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver, will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some patients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other gastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery symptoms whatsoever.\u00a0\nKeeping the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\n\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\n\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it easier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong but regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the same effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3) How will I know when my liver is clean?\nEveryone\u2019s results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as well as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder are never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize toxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is to judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will simply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others may take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and resolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment, emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to be loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the Oxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages of cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in foul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a timely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth, and slick in appearance.\n\u00a0\n4) Will I experience a healing crisis?\nA healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during cleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. This process can include physical indications caused by these toxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common indications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental clarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or sleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple indications while others have one or none. These indications will go away in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, many people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense of well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I strongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process and perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and far-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\n\u00a0\n5) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?\nYou may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a liver cleanse.

The green husk also contains organic iodine, which assists the cleansing of harmful organisms.Organic Epazote (leaves, seed)Rich in ascaridole, epazote is an herb of choice for attacking and expelling various harmful organisms that take up residence in the intestinal tract.Wildcrafted Quassia (bark)The Quassia grows naturally throughout South America and has a particular interesting quality -- no bugs or insects ever bother it. The resin contains a compound known as quasi, which naturally repels insects.Organic Clove (bud)Clove Bud is considered one of the best herbs for killing eggs from harmful organisms and it also discourages fungus.Organic wormwood [Artemisia absinthium] (leaf/stem)Wormwood has been used as an intestinal cleansing herb as far back as 1600BC.

Requiring no electricity, simply pour the water to be purified in the top of the unit and it flows through the ProOne G2.0 filter(s) fully purified and ready for drinking. Once you try it, you will not settle for anything less. The Propur Nomad  gravity fed water filtration system comes with everything you need to get started drinking the best water possible.\u00a0 The system comes standard with:\n\n\n\nYour choice of ProOne G2.0 filter configuration\n\n\nConstructed of heavy duty ONE piece stainless steel\n\n\nAll metal spigot*\n\n\nIncludes a non-slip base pad\n\n\n*The new and improved Propur Solid Stainless Steel Spigot now comes standard.\u00a0 Sleek design, easy to use and install, and built to last.\u00a0 The new built-in stopping points provide precise on and off positions.\u00a0 Also, the special shaped rubber washers are designed to create a tight seal and prevent any leaks.\u00a0 There isn't a better stainless steel spigot in the market and it now comes standard with your purchase of any Propur water filtration unit.About the filter: \u00a0 The key to any water filtration system is the filter.\u00a0 The Propur Nomad comes equipped with your choice of ProOne G2.0 fluoride filter elements which are the result of years of research, design, development and innovation. \u00a0The new ProOne G2.0 Water & Fluoride filter is a two stage filter that combines silver impregnated self-sterilizing white ceramic with new AquaMetix media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, ALL-IN-ONE filter element.\u00a0 No more add-on fluoride filters that slow down flow rate or hang down into the lower clean water reservoir.\u00a0 There is no other filter like this on the market.Scientifically tested by an independent, 3rd party, certified lab:\n\u00a0\nIn addition to primary contaminants such as pathogenic bacteria and cysts, the ProOne G2.0 Water & Fluoride filter elements help reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines (ammonia with chlorine), hydrofluorosilicic acid (the latest form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands) and sodium hexa fluorosilicate.\u00a0 Plus the latest test results show the new ProOne G2.0 Water & Fluoride filter removes glyphosate.\u00a0 More commonly known as Monsanto's Roundup, glyphosate is a very common herbicide used in commercial farming and landscaping.\u00a0 Glyphosate water contamination is increasing due to the wide-spread use of Roundup in GMO crops. \u00a0 Protect you and your family from the many unnatural and harmful chemicals found in your water supply with the ProOne G2.0 Water & Fluoride filter. Easy to install, use and clean - no priming required.\u00a0 The 2.75\" diameter gives you up to 54% more surface area for greater filtration performance compared to other conventional 2\" x 9\" filter elements.\u00a0 The new ProOne G2.0 Water & Fluoride filter elements are tested to meet NSF/ANSI standards 42, 53 and 61.\u00a0 Summary: Gravity filtration is the best way to purify your water.\u00a0 Unlike reverse osmosis or distillation, the Propur filters do not eliminate the beneficial minerals naturally found in water.\u00a0 Reverse osmosis systems also require an ultraviolet (UV) light to kill bacteria such as e-coli and giardia.\u00a0 This makes the reverse osmosis systems harder to maintain, less mobile, and dependent upon an electrical source.\u00a0 Whether for daily use or for emergency preparedness; whether you want to purify river water, well water, pool water, stream water, rainwater, swamp water or simple tap water Propur water purification system is the answer. Propur has taken great care in designing a non-drip spigot and the housing around the filter itself to avoid leakage and defect problems.\u00a0 Like allPropur products, it is backed by their guarantee of customer satisfaction.  **INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS:\u00a0 Please select USPS Priority Mail International to receive correct shipping rate.\u00a0 International orders without this shipping method selected may be delayed or cancelled.\u00a0 You may contact Infowars customer service at 1-888-253-3139 or by email at [email\u00a0protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ if you have any questions.** ***Propur products ship directly from the manufacturer, separate from other Infowars products you may also order.

Try to incorporate the following dietary guidelines to reduce your toxin exposure while cleansing.\n\nTry to purchase organic or locally grown foods as conventional foods are often over-processed, sprayed with pesticides, or grown in nutrient depleted soil.\nTry to include healthy oils in your diet such as coconut, hemp, flax seed, or olive.\nAvoid cow's milk and cheese during the cleanse, instead try almond or hemp milk.\nAvoid foods that contain gluten, such as cereal grains, wheat, barley, white flour, pasta, bread, couscous, flour, tortillas, cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, chips, imitation fish, hot dogs, and fried foods.\nAvoid alcoholic beverages.\nAvoid diet sodas and other products often contain artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame, neotame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Substitute with natural sweeteners such as honey, stevia, or coconut sugar.\nAvoid foods that contain high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, molasses, white sugar, dextrose, sorbitol, processed fructose, and sucrose.\nReplace table salt (sodium chloride) with himalayan salt.\nAvoid soy products. Most soy contains pesticide residue and is genetically modified. Soybeans are also high in phytic acid which is damaging to the digestive tract and blocks the absorption of nutrients and essential minerals.\nCaffeine, in moderation, is acceptable during your cleanse. Try organic tea or coffee without creamers and use natural sweeteners such as raw honey.\n\nWhat To Expect During Your Liver Cleanse\nOxy-Powder can cause watery stools, so make sure a bathroom is nearby. If your stools are liquid, remember this is not diarrhea but the result of turning solid compacted fecal matter in the intestinal tract into a liquid or gas.\nA small percentage of people may experience what is known as a healing crisis. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. Don't get discouraged.\nBefore You Start: Prepare Your Liver Cleanse Formula\nThe night before you start your cleanse, make the following 2 gallons and try to go to bed before 9pm to get a good night's rest.\nHow to Make the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula\n\nMaking Gallon #1: Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula: Pour out 3 ounces from your 1st gallon of distilled or purified water and add all of the Liver Shield formula and 2 tablespoons of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). Shake and refrigerate.\nMaking Gallon #2: Water/Apple Cider Vinegar Mixture (ACV): Pour out 2 ounces from your 2nd gallon of distilled or purified drinking water and add 1 ounce of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar. Shake and refrigerate.\n\nDay 1 - Start Your Liver Cleanse\n\n8:00am: Eat a healthy Breakfast Option (see breakfast diet options from day 1-4). Do not mix the fruits!\n9:00am: Drink one 8-ounce glass of Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n10:00-11:00am: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n12:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n1:00pm: Eat healthy Lunch Meal (see lunch diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your lunch meal.\n3:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n4:00-5:00pm: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n6:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n7:00pm: Eat healthy Dinner Meal (see dinner diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your dinner meal.\n8:00-10:00pm: Before bed, take 4 capsules of Oxy-Powder. Do not go to bed past 10pm!\n\nDays Two, Three, and Four of Your Liver Cleanse\nFollow the same instructions as Day 1, however, from 8:00-10:00pm: take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder.\nDay 5 of Your Liver Cleanse - Flush Day\u009d\n8:00am to 10:00am - Breakfast Meal (see breakfast diet options for day 5). Do not mix the fruits! We recommend using watermelon if it is available due to its high glutathione content.\nAfter breakfast, start preparing your Liver Cleanse Soup for lunch (see the recipe below) if you choose Option #1. Drink the Water/ACV Mixture as needed until lunch.\n12:00pm - Liver Supporting Lunch Meal. Choose from one of the following 3 options for your lunch meal:\nOption #1 - Liver Cleanse Soup (Recommended)\nTo maximize the liver's ability to detox and cleanse, choose a combination of foods which are high in naturally occurring sulphur and glutathione. Sulphur helps the liver cleanse harmful chemicals.\nThe ingredients in the liver cleanse soup include the following:\n\n1 Organic Beet (Washed and Chopped)\n2 Organic Carrots (Chopped)\n1 Cup Broccoli (Chopped)\n10 Organic Garlic Cloves (Minced)\n\u00bd Organic Onion (Chopped)\n\u00bc Organic Lemon\n2 Bay Leaves\n1 Teaspoon Himalayan Crystal Salt\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Turmeric\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Oregano\nOther liver cleansing foods you can use:artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, kale, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower can be added to the soup.\n\nTo prepare the Liver Cleanse Soup: Wash vegetables. Finely chop ingredients to desired consistency. Pour 32 ounces of distilled or purified water into a soup pot. Add all of the ingredients to the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and then simmer on low heat for one hour. Eat this soup for your lunch meal. After your meal, refrigerate the remaining portion of your soup for tomorrow's lunch meal (Day 6).\nOption #2 - Beet/Carrot Juice (Alternate):\n\nPeel and juice ingredients in a blender until desired consistency is achieved.\n3 Organic Carrots (washed and peeled)\n1 Organic Beet (washed and peeled)\n2 Organic Red Apples (washed and cut)\n6 Organic Kale Leaves\n\u00bd Organic Lemon (washed and peeled)\n\u00bd inch Ginger Root\n\nOption 3: (Water/ACV Mixture) - If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through lunch, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n2:00pm - Mid-Afternoon Snack. This will be your last meal of the day. Choose one of the following 3 options:\nOption #1: Organic Avocados, Organic Lime or Lemon, & Himalayan Crystal Salt. Eat 2-3 organic avocados. Season with salt and fresh lime or lemon juice to taste. Avocados help the body produce glutathione, which is necessary for the liver to cleanse harmful toxins.\nOption #2: Eat 6-8 ounces of raw organic walnuts. Walnuts contain the amino acid arginine, which is necessary to help the liver detoxify ammonia. Walnuts are also high in glutathione and omega-3 fatty acids which support normal liver detoxification. Make sure you chew the nuts until they are liquefied before swallowing.\nOption #3: Water Meal. If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through the afternoon, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n7:00pm - USP Epsom Salt: Mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom Salt in 8 ounces of warm purified water. Drink it as fast as you can. It is advisable to be near a bathroom when drinking the Epsom Salt as some people experience liquid stools within 20-30 minutes after ingestion.\n8:30pm to 9:00pm: Drink The Olive Oil & Juice: Drink \u00be cup (6 ounces) of organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil. A small amount (2 tablespoons) of freshly squeezed orange, grapefruit, or lemon juice may be added to improve the taste.\nHow to Drink the Olive Oil: It's important to drink all 6 ounces of the olive oil; below are three approaches to help your experience:\nApproach #1: Thicken the oil by refrigeration for a few hours prior to ingestion to make it go down quickly.\nApproach #2: Thin the oil by using a jar to mix \u00bd cup of fresh grapefruit or orange juice into the oil and shake until thin.\r\n\tApproach #3: To reduce the taste and texture, gather two cups, straw, and small amount of juice. Place the olive oil in one cup, juice in the other, and use the straw to alternate drinking between the two.\r\n\tImmediately after drinking the oil, go to bed and lie on your right side with your knees drawn up to your stomach for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, you can stretch out and go to sleep. If you experience cramping, walk around for ten minutes or so and then go back to bed. You may also feel nauseated during the night. This is due to the release of stored toxins from the liver and gallbladder. This is normal and a sign the liver cleanse is working.\nIf you feel the need to vomit, do so as this will help release toxins. If you vomit, this is a sure sign your body is extremely toxic and you should consider repeating the liver cleanse after a five day break. Do not take Oxy-Powder on this night.\nCongratulations! You have just completed your first liver cleanse.What to Expect After the Liver Cleanse\nUpon waking in the morning, immediately take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder. This will help your intestinal tract and body flush the stones released from the liver and gallbladder during the night. For breakfast, eat only fruit. For lunch eat the remaining portion of your liver cleanse soup. For dinner eat a healthy meal such as a salad and some protein.\nIf you would like to see the stones, they should appear in your bowel movements for one to two days. We recommend putting a cheap colander over the toilet to collect the stones and then rinse the fecal matter off in the sink. You will be amazed at what comes out of you.\nRepeat the Liver Cleanse if Necessary\nIf you are still experiencing indications after your third flush, this may be a sign you need additional cleanses. The most we have heard of someone completing is 20 back-to-back liver cleanses before their indications were significantly reduced.\nFrequently Asked Questions:1) Can a liver cleanse be performed if the gallbladder has been removed?Yes!\r\n When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates \r\nfor its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver,\r\n will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some \r\npatients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other \r\ngastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery \r\nsymptoms whatsoever.\u00a0Keeping\r\n the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is\r\n vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are\r\n required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and\r\n the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it \r\neasier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong \r\nbut regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a\r\n liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the \r\nsame effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\u00a03) How will I know when my liver is clean?Everyone\u2019s\r\n results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as \r\nwell as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder \r\nare never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize \r\ntoxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people\r\n require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses\r\n once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is \r\nto judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will \r\nsimply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others \r\nmay take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and \r\nresolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment,\r\n emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to \r\nbe loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the \r\nOxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages \r\nof cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in \r\nfoul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a \r\ntimely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth,\r\n and slick in appearance.4) Will I experience a healing crisis?A\r\n healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during \r\ncleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse \r\nduring and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. \r\nThe accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from \r\nthe body. This process can include physical indications caused by these \r\ntoxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common \r\nindications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental \r\nclarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or \r\nsleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple \r\nindications while others have one or none. These indications will go \r\naway in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, \r\nmany people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense \r\nof well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I \r\nstrongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process \r\nand perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and\r\n drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along\r\n with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and \r\nfar-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\u00a05) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?You\r\n may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a \r\nliver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from \r\nthe Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, \r\nwe do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who \r\ncan assist you more directly with these accommodations.\n"}, {"itemid": "SP-IWL-ANPLX-10PK", "subcat": "Infowars Life", "name": "Anthroplex 10 Pack", "img": ["anthroplex-10.jpg", "anthroplex-label_1_1.jpg"], "price": "$103.60", "desc": " Introducing Anthroplex, the twice daily pill foundation for men that contains key compounds like horny goat weed, zinc orotate, and a newly balanced blend of hand-selected organic herbs.\n\u00a0\nWhat You've Been Asking For: Anthroplex Is Finally Here\nFor years, listeners have been asking us to add certain ingredients like horny goat weed and zinc orotate to the Super Male Vitality formula, but the years of research and testing put into the precisely balanced Super Male Vitality formula have proven that the exact ratios of the cold pressed organic herbs are essential to maintain.\nThat's why Anthroplex works synergistically with the powerful Super Male Vitality formula in order to help restore your masculine foundation and stimulate vitality with its own blend of unique ingredients.\n\u00a0\nAnthroplex's Unique Formula & Ingredients\n\u00a0\nZinc Orotate\nZinc is an essential dietary mineral that's necessary for proper healthy immune system function, the normal breakdown of food and nutrients, and a number of other processes within the body pertaining to vitality.\n\u00a0\nHorny Goat Weed - Epimedium\nHorny goat weed, or epimedium, is an herb that has been used for ages in Chinese medicine for vitality, and has also been noted for its antioxidant activity.\n\u00a0\nTribulus Terrestris\nTribulus Terrestris has been used in Ayurvedic practice as an herb of choice for vitality, and is noted to contain a compound called protodioscin, which is the putative active component of the herb.\n\u00a0\nTongKat Ali\nAlso known as Malaysian ginseng, TongKat Ali has been traditionally held to support a number of natural functions in men, and was specifically added to the Anthroplex formula using a very specific ingredient ratio.\n\u00a0\nNow Is The Time...\nNow is the time to start fighting back and rebuilding your foundation.

They remain in your digestive system to help boost the growth of beneficial bacteria. Sources of prebiotics include fruits, raw honey, and legumes.\n2. What factors negatively affect intestinal flora?\u00a0The gut is a delicate environment that's susceptible to imbalance and can be significantly affected by what you put into your body. Friendly gut bacteria or gut bacteria balance may be negatively impacted by things such as certain unhealthy nutrition choices, prescription medications, and other factors.\n3.

In fact, it is essential to have a good balance of friendly bacteria in the gut for optimum health. Labeled by many as the 'good bacteria' in your gut, probiotics are living microorganisms that live in your digestive tract and support good digestive health.\nBiome Defense by Infowars Life is a probiotic and prebiotic supplement that helps populate your digestive tract with a mix of beneficial bacteria to support digestion and boost the immune system.\nMany people consider a daily probiotic to be as important to their health as a multi-vitamin, and for good reason: a healthy body requires a healthy gut!\nThe 7-Year Creation Story of Biome Defense\u2122\nFor years, Alex and Dr. Edward Group have used and recommended multiple different probiotic formulas to help replenish good bacteria in the gut. The problem was, however, that in order to get the quality and potency they wanted, they had to go out and purchase 2, 3, or even 4 different products at a time.\nAnd even then, there were issues with quality, the number of strains in the product, and of course a question of whether or not they were supporting the right companies with their purchases.\nThat's what prompted Dr. Group to begin a seven-year journey to develop the most advanced, all-in-one, full-spectrum, digestive and intestinal health probiotic formula out there*****. \nThis wasn't easy, and it took years to even start sourcing the right ingredients for the groundbreaking formula that would eventually come to be known as Biome Defense\u2122 by Infowars Life. One challenge was finding super high quality probiotics created from trustworthy sources. The other challenge was to find a probiotic company that would agree to use our non-toxic, non-GMO certified organic gum acacia, which in itself works as a prebiotic; an innovation that was a world's first in the industry. \nThe world's leading probiotic manufacturers were shocked that Dr. Group refused to settle for cheap probiotic strains with bigger margins. But instead of buckling to industry heads, we are now proud to offer Biome Defense\u2122: a complete prebiotic and probiotic formulation with over 50 billion live and active cultures from 23 probiotic strains. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Top 5 Reasons You Need Biome Defense\n1. Digestive Support\nProbiotics are friendly organisms that help assist the digestive process and encourage proper nutrient absorption. Your digestive tract is a complex 'machine' that converts nutrients into energy, and supporting your digestive tract is one of the most effective measures you can take to encourage your health.\n\u00a0\n2.

It may also  help regenerate the body's natural intracellular antioxidants.The Invention of DNA Force'For years, I'd used many different antioxidants and healthy aging formulas to enhance my own health and that of my patients. However, I always had to use two or three products. I was never able to find a complete, vegan-friendly formula that contained all the cell protecting and healthy aging ingredients. This prompted a lengthy journey to develop the most advanced, all-in-one, full-spectrum, graceful aging, DNA protection, telomere enhancing, antioxidant formula in the world. It is also vegetarian and vegan friendly -- no animal sources. This was no easy task and it took an incredible amount of time to create and source the perfect formula. One challenge I faced was effectively including the top age reducing ingredients into one synergistic blend. In fact, Infowars Life is the first company in the world to offer this unique product containing a blend of the worlds most researched ingredients. When I discussed the formula with the world's leading age reducing scientists, they were shocked. 'Nobody has ever developed a age defying, cell protecting blend like this before. Do you realize it will be one of the most expensive blends ever created to support graceful and healthy aging?' It didn't matter. Unlike other manufacturers whose only concern is low costs and high margins, our number one priority is quality; we produce the best products possible. We're proud to say that the result of those efforts is DNA Force, the most complete, full-spectrum age support product in the world.' \u00a0 -- Dr. Edward F.

When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates for its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver, will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some patients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other gastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery symptoms whatsoever.\u00a0\nKeeping the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\n\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\n\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it easier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong but regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the same effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3) How will I know when my liver is clean?\nEveryone\u2019s results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as well as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder are never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize toxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is to judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will simply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others may take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and resolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment, emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to be loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the Oxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages of cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in foul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a timely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth, and slick in appearance.\n\u00a0\n4) Will I experience a healing crisis?\nA healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during cleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. This process can include physical indications caused by these toxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common indications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental clarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or sleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple indications while others have one or none. These indications will go away in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, many people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense of well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I strongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process and perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and far-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\n\u00a0\n5) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?\nYou may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a liver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from the Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, we do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who can assist you more directly with these accommodations."}, {"itemid": "SP-IWL-LIVSHD-2PK", "subcat": "Infowars Life", "name": "Liver Shield: 2 Pack", "img": ["livershield_2pak.jpg", "livershield_label_2.jpg"], "price": "$103.60", "desc": " \n<!--\r\np.important-info a {\r\nfont-size: 34pt;\r\ntext-decoration: underline;\r\n}\r\n-->\nIs your liver toxic?  \nClick here for the Advanced Liver Cleanse\n  With all of the toxic additives in the food supply, the pharmaceutical drugs in the water, and of course the consumption of alcohol, the answer may be a resounding \u201cYES!\u201d \nThe all-new Infowars Life Liver Shield\u2122\u00a0is a 100% all natural blend of powerful organic and wildcrafted herbs specifically formulated to support natural function and detoxification of the liver and gallbladder.\nThe liver is responsible for over 500 separate functions in the body, and is known to be your primary 'filter' within the body. \nFollowing prolonged toxic buildup, your liver can become full of fatty deposits, built up toxins, and even\u00a0 dangerous objects known as 'liver stones'.

A normal and healthy bowel moves in a timely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth, and slick in appearance.\n\u00a0\n4) Will I experience a healing crisis?\nA healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during cleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. This process can include physical indications caused by these toxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common indications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental clarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or sleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple indications while others have one or none. These indications will go away in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, many people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense of well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I strongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process and perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and far-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\n\u00a0\n5) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?\nYou may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a liver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from the Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, we do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who can assist you more directly with these accommodations."}, {"itemid": "IWL-LIVDEF-1", "subcat": "Infowars Life", "name": "Living Defense", "img": ["livingdefense_single2.jpg", "livingdefenselabelupdate.jpg"], "price": "$44.95", "desc": " Help Eliminate Toxic & Harmful Organisms From Your Body Living Defense\u2122 is a comprehensive blend of all-natural ingredients formulated to promote the cleansing and detoxification of harmful organisms.

The high tannin content of the green hull is primarily responsible for this effect. Other constituents such as juglandin, juglone, and juglandic acid are also involved in the purging process. Research suggests black walnut can oxygenate the blood to create a hostile environment to harmful organisms. The green husk also contains organic iodine, which assists the cleansing of harmful organisms.Organic Epazote (leaves, seed)Rich in ascaridole, epazote is an herb of choice for attacking and expelling various harmful organisms that take up residence in the intestinal tract.Wildcrafted Quassia (bark)The Quassia grows naturally throughout South America and has a particular interesting quality -- no bugs or insects ever bother it. The resin contains a compound known as quasi, which naturally repels insects.Organic Clove (bud)Clove Bud is considered one of the best herbs for killing eggs from harmful organisms and it also discourages fungus.Organic wormwood [Artemisia absinthium] (leaf/stem)Wormwood has been used as an intestinal cleansing herb as far back as 1600BC.

These toxins come from air, food, water, beverages, harmful organisms, stress, radiation and many other potential sources of which many such toxins may end up in the intestinal lining.This led Dr. Group on a journey to create the most powerful oxygen releasing, toxin neutralizing colon cleansing product on the market. It all started by studying the works of the most famous ozone and reactive oxygen species scientists worldwide dating back to the late 1700's. \u00a0With the help of many brilliant scientists and many years of painstaking trial and error, Dr. Group was able to stabilize reactive oxygen species to magnesium compounds, and Oxy-Powder\u00ae was born.

Selenium even plays a role in the natural function of reproductive health, DNA production, and eyesight.\nAs a powerful antioxidant, selenium helps fight free radicals and may even be considered a super antioxidant' because of the way in which it may support other antioxidants.\nOne of its most valuable roles is supporting the natural production of glutathione peroxidase, a key antioxidant enzyme that supports the thyroid and even helps recycle vitamin E and vitamin C into active scavengers of free radicals.\nInfowars Life\u2019s high-potency Bio-True Selenium capsules are made from 100% certified organic mustard seeds and each serving delivers 200 mcg of food-derived, vegan-friendly selenium.\nThe Top 5 Reasons You Need Selenium\n1. A Powerful Antioxidant\nSelenium is an antioxidant that fights free radicals that damage cells and may lead to premature aging. Selenium\u2019s antioxidant status also helps support the immune system naturally.\n2. Healthy Thyroid Support\nMuch like iodine, selenium is important for normal thyroid function. Selenium is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones, and a selenium deficiency can negatively affect healthy hormone balance and normal thyroid function.\n3. Supports Cardiovascular Health\nSelenium plays a notable role in supporting normal cardiovascular health. Selenium can benefit heart health by soothing oxidative stress and supporting normal circulation.\n4. Food-Sourced Formula\nUnlike many selenium formulas out there, Infowars Life Bio-True Selenium\u2122 is never synthetic. It\u2019s a whole food form of selenium extracted from 100% certified organic mustard seed. Each high-potency capsule delivers 200 mcg of highly bioavailable, organically sourced selenium.\n5. Unparalleled Quality\nInfowars Life\u2019s high-potency selenium formula is produced in the USA at a state of the art manufacturing facility equipped with all modern equipment that adheres to cGMP guidelines and has achieved ISO 22000 certification -- the highest in food safety.\nInteresting Facts About Selenium\n\nSelenium concentrations decline with age.\nSelenium is more concentrated in the thyroid than any other area of the body.\nFoods reputed to be good sources of selenium include Brazil Nuts, brewer's yeast, wheat germ, garlic, grains, sunflower seeds, walnuts, raisins, and seafood.\nSoil levels of selenium can vary dramatically from one region to the next.\n\nThe Health Benefits of Selenium\n\nSelenium is one of the body's primary antioxidant enzymes\nSupports normal thyroid and immune function in healthy individuals.\nEncourages normal oxygen levels in the heart.\nSupports healthy bones and joints.\nRequired for the production of prostaglandins that promote healthy blood flow.\nIn synergy with vitamin E, selenium supports energy producing cells.\n\nThe Top 3 Questions People Ask About Selenium\n1. How much selenium is enough? The recommended dietary allowance of selenium for adults can range from 55-200mcg. Adult females may need as little as 55 mcg; adult males as little as 70 mcg; pregnant females at least 65 mcg; and 75 mcg/day for lactating females. For adults, the safe upper limit is 400 mcg/day.\n2. Why is consistent consumption of selenium important? Selenium is a trace mineral and we only need a small amount of it. However, because it plays a role in many important functions, it may get used quickly. A selenium supplement can help ensure regular and consistent availability of this important nutrient.\n3. Why is mustard seed used? Mustard seeds are an excellent, vegan-friendly source of selenium and other nutrients.

Raw elemental iodine is a controlled substance both at a State and Federal level. The licensing, approvals and regulatory documentary procedures are exacting and costly.Bound forms of iodine must first be separated, clarified and purified from other binding components or impurities into a USP-grade (United States Pharmaceutical), mono-elemental iodine as certified USP resublimated iodine crystals. In this purified crystal form, iodine is a highly reactive and toxic substance. However, when the purified USP iodine crystals are subjected to a proprietary process it becomes nano-colloidalized and transforms into a form of elemental nascent iodine, also referred to as monoatomic iodine, without the addition of iodides!Shocking Statistics About Iodine\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization's Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, iodine deficiency is a public health problem in 54 countries.\nThe CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world (Fortunately, it is the easiest to correct).\nThe 2013 USGS iodine commodity summary warns that there are no comparable substitutes for iodine.\nInformation published by UNICEF notes that iodine deficiency is the most avoidable cause of stunted physical and intellectual development.\n\nWhat Are The Health Benefits Of Nascent Iodine?\n\nProper iodine levels may provide support for normal response to environmental and dietary toxins.\nSupports thyroid health.\nMay support breast milk production and quality.\n\nWhy Is Survival Shield X-2 The Best Nascent Iodine Available?\n\nSurvival Shield X-2 is created from salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface.\u00a0\nIt is tested for radiation by our quality control experts before being placed for sale.\u00a0\nIt is approximately 50% stronger than our original Survival Shield formulation.\u00a0\nIt is a true glycerite of natural USP grade iodine\nThe nascent iodine in Survival Shield X-2 is not subjected to direct heat, harsh chemicals, or alcohol.\nThe transformative process produces a stable product that no other brand can match!\nCompletely non-GMO certified.\nVegan-friendly and completely non-toxic.\nIt provides high elemental iodine uptake.\nContains NO inefficient iodides.\nDoes not sting or burn.\n\nIMPORTANT SHIPPING INFORMATION:\u00a0International Customers, please check with your country's customs office regarding the import of the products.\u00a0\u00a0As the buyer, you are solely responsible for any import restrictions, prohibited import items, taxes, tariffs, fees and other duties.\u00a0These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.\u00a0\u00a0This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. \u00a0Testimonials represent a cross section of the range of results that appear to be typical with these products.

Water is forced through narrow fibers under high pressure. Clean water exits through tiny pores in the walls of the hollow fibers, but bacteria, viruses, protozoa and other contaminants are trapped inside the hollow fibers and are flushed out by backwashing. This is a highly efficient method of filtration.\n\nThe feed water bucket (2 liter capacity) is filled with water.\nThe 80-micron textile pre-filter (inside the feed water bucket) removes coarser particles and is easy to clean.\nWater passes through the meter-long blue PVC hose and gravity creates sufficient pressure on the membrane cartridge in order to reach a high flow rate.\nUltra filtration takes place in the hollow fiber membrane cartridge - a pore size of 20 nanometers (0.02 microns) retains bacteria, viruses, parasites and fine dirt particles.\nThe blue tap is turned to release purified water.\nBackwash the membrane by squeezing the red backwash bulb 3 times with both taps closed and then releasing the dirty water from the red tap. Water from the red tap should never be consumed.\n\n\n\nThe Science Behind LifeStraw:\nBacked by serious research in our international labs and extensive testing in the field, LifeStraw and LifeStraw Family have been distributed to nearly every major international humanitarian disaster since 2005 and in broad public health campaigns in the millions.\nThe same high-tech design used in places like Haiti, Indonesia, South Africa, Kenya, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and Bangladesh is now available in the USA and Canada.

Since dissolved ionized solids such as salts and minerals increase the conductivity of a solution, a TDS meter measures the conductivity of the solution and estimates the TDS from that. A TDS meter typically displays the TDS in parts per million (ppm). For example, a TDS reading of 1 ppm would indicate there is 1 milligram of dissolved solids in each kilogram of water. TDS is a measure of total dissolved solids and NOT dissolved contaminants. A higher TDS can simply be high calcium or mineral content. As Propur filters are made from minerals, TDS may be higher after the water has been treated. This does not mean the filter isn't working, it means the TDS meter is picking up the minerals that are naturally released by the filter. A PPM meter is the same as a TDS meter, it is simply measures dissolved solids in water. A TDS meter is not generally recognized in the industry as a proper means of testing water for contaminants. They were created years ago by the manufacturers of reverse osmosis systems as a means of demonstrating the effectiveness of RO which removes most if not all minerals.\"*The removal/reduction of contaminants or other substances, filter replacement period and/or life expectancy in gallons may vary depending on the level of contaminants present in your water supply. Some contaminants may be more easily filtered than others.

There is no other filter like this on the market.

Easy to install, use and clean - no priming required.\u00a0 The 2.75\" diameter gives you up to 54% more surface area for greater filtration performance compared to other conventional 2\" x 9\" filter elements.\u00a0 The new ProOne G2.0 Water & Fluoride filter elements are tested to meet NSF/ANSI standards 42, 53 and 61.\u00a0 Visit the ProOne G2.0 Technical Information Page for further information.Summary: Gravity filtration is the best way to purify your water.\u00a0 Unlike reverse osmosis or distillation, the Propur filters do not eliminate the beneficial minerals naturally found in water.\u00a0 Reverse osmosis systems also require an ultraviolet (UV) light to kill bacteria such as e-coli and giardia.\u00a0 This makes the reverse osmosis systems harder to maintain, less mobile, and dependent upon an electrical source.\u00a0 Whether for daily use or for emergency preparedness; whether you want to purify river water, well water, pool water, stream water, rainwater, swamp water or simple tap water Propur water purification system is the answer. Propur has taken great care in designing a non-drip spigot and the housing around the filter itself to avoid leakage and defect problems.\u00a0 Like allPropur products, it is backed by their guarantee of customer satisfaction. **INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS:\u00a0 Please select USPS Priority Mail International to receive correct shipping rate.\u00a0 International orders without this shipping method selected may be delayed or cancelled.\u00a0 You may contact Infowars customer service at 1-888-253-3139 or by email at [email\u00a0protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ if you have any questions.** ***Propur products ship directly from the manufacturer, separate from other Infowars products you may also order.

Try to incorporate the following dietary guidelines to reduce your toxin exposure while cleansing.\n\nTry to purchase organic or locally grown foods as conventional foods are often over-processed, sprayed with pesticides, or grown in nutrient depleted soil.\nTry to include healthy oils in your diet such as coconut, hemp, flax seed, or olive.\nAvoid cow's milk and cheese during the cleanse, instead try almond or hemp milk.\nAvoid foods that contain gluten, such as cereal grains, wheat, barley, white flour, pasta, bread, couscous, flour, tortillas, cakes, crackers, cookies, pastries, chips, imitation fish, hot dogs, and fried foods.\nAvoid alcoholic beverages.\nAvoid diet sodas and other products often contain artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame, neotame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Substitute with natural sweeteners such as honey, stevia, or coconut sugar.\nAvoid foods that contain high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, molasses, white sugar, dextrose, sorbitol, processed fructose, and sucrose.\nReplace table salt (sodium chloride) with himalayan salt.\nAvoid soy products. Most soy contains pesticide residue and is genetically modified. Soybeans are also high in phytic acid which is damaging to the digestive tract and blocks the absorption of nutrients and essential minerals.\nCaffeine, in moderation, is acceptable during your cleanse. Try organic tea or coffee without creamers and use natural sweeteners such as raw honey.\n\nWhat To Expect During Your Liver Cleanse\nOxy-Powder can cause watery stools, so make sure a bathroom is nearby. If your stools are liquid, remember this is not diarrhea but the result of turning solid compacted fecal matter in the intestinal tract into a liquid or gas.\nA small percentage of people may experience what is known as a healing crisis. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. Don't get discouraged.\nBefore You Start: Prepare Your Liver Cleanse Formula\nThe night before you start your cleanse, make the following 2 gallons and try to go to bed before 9pm to get a good night's rest.\nHow to Make the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula\n\nMaking Gallon #1: Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula: Pour out 3 ounces from your 1st gallon of distilled or purified water and add all of the Liver Shield formula and 2 tablespoons of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). Shake and refrigerate.\nMaking Gallon #2: Water/Apple Cider Vinegar Mixture (ACV): Pour out 2 ounces from your 2nd gallon of distilled or purified drinking water and add 1 ounce of Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar. Shake and refrigerate.\n\nDay 1 - Start Your Liver Cleanse\n\n8:00am: Eat a healthy Breakfast Option (see breakfast diet options from day 1-4). Do not mix the fruits!\n9:00am: Drink one 8-ounce glass of Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n10:00-11:00am: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n12:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n1:00pm: Eat healthy Lunch Meal (see lunch diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your lunch meal.\n3:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n4:00-5:00pm: Water and Snack (optional). Drink 12 ounces of your Water/ACV Mixture.\n6:00pm: Drink one 8-ounce glass of the Liver Shield Liver Cleanse Formula.\n7:00pm: Eat healthy Dinner Meal (see dinner diet options from day 1-4). Drink only the Water/ACV Mixture with your dinner meal.\n8:00-10:00pm: Before bed, take 4 capsules of Oxy-Powder. Do not go to bed past 10pm!\n\nDays Two, Three, and Four of Your Liver Cleanse\nFollow the same instructions as Day 1, however, from 8:00-10:00pm: take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder.\nDay 5 of Your Liver Cleanse - Flush Day\u009d\n8:00am to 10:00am - Breakfast Meal (see breakfast diet options for day 5). Do not mix the fruits! We recommend using watermelon if it is available due to its high glutathione content.\nAfter breakfast, start preparing your Liver Cleanse Soup for lunch (see the recipe below) if you choose Option #1. Drink the Water/ACV Mixture as needed until lunch.\n12:00pm - Liver Supporting Lunch Meal. Choose from one of the following 3 options for your lunch meal:\nOption #1 - Liver Cleanse Soup (Recommended)\nTo maximize the liver's ability to detox and cleanse, choose a combination of foods which are high in naturally occurring sulphur and glutathione. Sulphur helps the liver cleanse harmful chemicals.\nThe ingredients in the liver cleanse soup include the following:\n\n1 Organic Beet (Washed and Chopped)\n2 Organic Carrots (Chopped)\n1 Cup Broccoli (Chopped)\n10 Organic Garlic Cloves (Minced)\n\u00bd Organic Onion (Chopped)\n\u00bc Organic Lemon\n2 Bay Leaves\n1 Teaspoon Himalayan Crystal Salt\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Turmeric\n\u00bd Teaspoon Organic Oregano\nOther liver cleansing foods you can use:artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, kale, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower can be added to the soup.\n\nTo prepare the Liver Cleanse Soup: Wash vegetables. Finely chop ingredients to desired consistency. Pour 32 ounces of distilled or purified water into a soup pot. Add all of the ingredients to the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and then simmer on low heat for one hour. Eat this soup for your lunch meal. After your meal, refrigerate the remaining portion of your soup for tomorrow's lunch meal (Day 6).\nOption #2 - Beet/Carrot Juice (Alternate):\n\nPeel and juice ingredients in a blender until desired consistency is achieved.\n3 Organic Carrots (washed and peeled)\n1 Organic Beet (washed and peeled)\n2 Organic Red Apples (washed and cut)\n6 Organic Kale Leaves\n\u00bd Organic Lemon (washed and peeled)\n\u00bd inch Ginger Root\n\nOption 3: (Water/ACV Mixture) - If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through lunch, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n2:00pm - Mid-Afternoon Snack. This will be your last meal of the day. Choose one of the following 3 options:\nOption #1: Organic Avocados, Organic Lime or Lemon, & Himalayan Crystal Salt. Eat 2-3 organic avocados. Season with salt and fresh lime or lemon juice to taste. Avocados help the body produce glutathione, which is necessary for the liver to cleanse harmful toxins.\nOption #2: Eat 6-8 ounces of raw organic walnuts. Walnuts contain the amino acid arginine, which is necessary to help the liver detoxify ammonia. Walnuts are also high in glutathione and omega-3 fatty acids which support normal liver detoxification. Make sure you chew the nuts until they are liquefied before swallowing.\nOption #3: Water Meal. If you are not hungry or you feel that you can fast through the afternoon, drink as much of the Water/ACV Mixture as you can.\n7:00pm - USP Epsom Salt: Mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom Salt in 8 ounces of warm purified water. Drink it as fast as you can. It is advisable to be near a bathroom when drinking the Epsom Salt as some people experience liquid stools within 20-30 minutes after ingestion.\n8:30pm to 9:00pm: Drink The Olive Oil & Juice: Drink \u00be cup (6 ounces) of organic cold pressed extra virgin olive oil. A small amount (2 tablespoons) of freshly squeezed orange, grapefruit, or lemon juice may be added to improve the taste.\nHow to Drink the Olive Oil: It's important to drink all 6 ounces of the olive oil; below are three approaches to help your experience:\nApproach #1: Thicken the oil by refrigeration for a few hours prior to ingestion to make it go down quickly.\nApproach #2: Thin the oil by using a jar to mix \u00bd cup of fresh grapefruit or orange juice into the oil and shake until thin.\r\n\tApproach #3: To reduce the taste and texture, gather two cups, straw, and small amount of juice. Place the olive oil in one cup, juice in the other, and use the straw to alternate drinking between the two.\r\n\tImmediately after drinking the oil, go to bed and lie on your right side with your knees drawn up to your stomach for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, you can stretch out and go to sleep. If you experience cramping, walk around for ten minutes or so and then go back to bed. You may also feel nauseated during the night. This is due to the release of stored toxins from the liver and gallbladder. This is normal and a sign the liver cleanse is working.\nIf you feel the need to vomit, do so as this will help release toxins. If you vomit, this is a sure sign your body is extremely toxic and you should consider repeating the liver cleanse after a five day break. Do not take Oxy-Powder on this night.\nCongratulations! You have just completed your first liver cleanse.What to Expect After the Liver Cleanse\nUpon waking in the morning, immediately take 6 capsules of Oxy-Powder. This will help your intestinal tract and body flush the stones released from the liver and gallbladder during the night. For breakfast, eat only fruit. For lunch eat the remaining portion of your liver cleanse soup. For dinner eat a healthy meal such as a salad and some protein.\nIf you would like to see the stones, they should appear in your bowel movements for one to two days. We recommend putting a cheap colander over the toilet to collect the stones and then rinse the fecal matter off in the sink. You will be amazed at what comes out of you.\nRepeat the Liver Cleanse if Necessary\nIf you are still experiencing indications after your third flush, this may be a sign you need additional cleanses. The most we have heard of someone completing is 20 back-to-back liver cleanses before their indications were significantly reduced.\nFrequently Asked Questions:1) Can a liver cleanse be performed if the gallbladder has been removed?Yes!\r\n When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates \r\nfor its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver,\r\n will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some \r\npatients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other \r\ngastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery \r\nsymptoms whatsoever.\u00a0Keeping\r\n the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is\r\n vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are\r\n required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and\r\n the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it \r\neasier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong \r\nbut regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a\r\n liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the \r\nsame effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\u00a03) How will I know when my liver is clean?Everyone\u2019s\r\n results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as \r\nwell as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder \r\nare never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize \r\ntoxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people\r\n require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses\r\n once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is \r\nto judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will \r\nsimply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others \r\nmay take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and \r\nresolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment,\r\n emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to \r\nbe loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the \r\nOxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages \r\nof cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in \r\nfoul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a \r\ntimely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth,\r\n and slick in appearance.4) Will I experience a healing crisis?A\r\n healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during \r\ncleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse \r\nduring and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. \r\nThe accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from \r\nthe body. This process can include physical indications caused by these \r\ntoxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common \r\nindications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental \r\nclarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or \r\nsleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple \r\nindications while others have one or none. These indications will go \r\naway in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, \r\nmany people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense \r\nof well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I \r\nstrongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process \r\nand perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and\r\n drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along\r\n with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and \r\nfar-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\u00a05) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?You\r\n may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a \r\nliver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from \r\nthe Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, \r\nwe do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who \r\ncan assist you more directly with these accommodations.\n"}, {"itemid": "AC-APMICROB-1", "subcat": "Wellness", "name": "Alexapure Breeze Micro Negative Ion Generator", "img": ["alex-pur-thumbnail.png", "alex-pur-thumbnail3.png", "alex-pur-thumbnail2.png"], "price": "$24.95", "desc": " Alexapure Breeze Micro Negative Ion Generator\nThe Alexapure Breeze Micro gives you compact air purification on the go.

When the gallbladder is removed, the human body generally compensates for its absence. The bile duct, found on the visceral side of the liver, will increase in size to take over the task of bile storage. Some patients experience diarrhea, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other gastrointestinal disorders whereas others exhibit no post-surgery symptoms whatsoever.\u00a0\nKeeping the Liver clean, as it no longer has the support of the Gallbladder, is vital to help promote a healthy and strong digestive system.\n\u00a02) Which salt is better to use? Sea Salt vs Epsom\n\u00a0Epsom Salts\u00a0are required for the liver flush. They provide a strong laxative action and the Magnesium Sulphate helps relax the bile ducts, which can make it easier to pass larger stones. The taste of Epsom salts is quite strong but regardless of taste, it is an essential ingredient when completing a liver flush. Sea Salt such as Himalayan crystal salt will not have the same effect, there are no alternatives or substitutes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3) How will I know when my liver is clean?\nEveryone\u2019s results differ depending on their diet, exercise patterns, and age as well as physical and emotional stress levels. The liver and gallbladder are never 100% clean since their intended function is to metabolize toxic and potentially toxic material. In terms of cleansing, most people require a minimum of 3 cleansing sessions followed by periodic cleanses once or twice per year for maintenance. One of the best suggestions is to judge from the lessening of your indications. Many indications will simply resolve spontaneously after the 2nd or 3rd cleanse, while others may take 6 or 7 consecutive cleanses and require the identification and resolution of other factors, i.e. supplementation, external environment, emotional trauma, spinal/nerve damage, etc. The stools may continue to be loose or semi-solid due to the oxidation process from the Oxy-Powder\u00ae. Some people will notice a foul smell in the initial stages of cleansing. Over time, there should be a noticeable decrease in foul-smelling bowel movements. A normal and healthy bowel moves in a timely manner, with the stool being lighter in color, relatively smooth, and slick in appearance.\n\u00a0\n4) Will I experience a healing crisis?\nA healing crisis describes a phenomenon that sometimes occurs during cleansing and detoxification of the body and liver. You may feel worse during and after your liver cleanse than you did before you started it. The accumulation of toxic material must be processed to be removed from the body. This process can include physical indications caused by these toxins as they are further metabolized or oxidized. The most common indications include: fatigue, headache, minor rash, lack of mental clarity, joint or muscle ache, irritability, difficulty sleeping (or sleeping too much), or mood swings. Some people experience multiple indications while others have one or none. These indications will go away in 2 to 3 days as the body naturally expels these toxins. However, many people report feeling energetic and experience an increased sense of well being after the initial liver cleanse. If you feel worse, I strongly suggest that you need to continue with the cleansing process and perform a couple more cleanses. In addition, adopting an organic,\u00a0raw foods diet\u00a0and drinking only purified water with organic raw apple cider vinegar along with plenty of rest may help you to feel better. Massage and far-infrared saunas may also help to eliminate toxins from the body.\n\u00a0\n5) Can I take Medications while I am performing a Liver Cleanse?\nYou may continue to take your prescription medications while performing a liver cleanse. However be sure to take any medications well away from the Livatrex formula and 3-6 hours apart from the Oxy-Powder.\u00a0However, we do suggest working with a reputable practitioner in your area, who can assist you more directly with these accommodations."}, {"itemid": "AC-MOD-PS-1", "subcat": "Wellness", "name": "Modifilan", "img": ["modifilan_capsules.jpg"], "price": "$103.60", "desc": " Modifilan is a natural dietary supplement created from concentrated Laminaria Japonica brown seaweed extract.\u00a0\u00a0 It is a natural food supplement which contains several beneficial organic elements.\u00a0 One of the main qualities of Laminaria is its high content of alginates, which are enhanced by the extraction process used to produce Modifilan.Modifilan is a whole food.

These toxins come from air, food, water, beverages, harmful organisms, stress, radiation and many other potential sources of which many such toxins may end up in the intestinal lining.This led Dr. Group on a journey to create the most powerful oxygen releasing, toxin neutralizing colon cleansing product on the market. It all started by studying the works of the most famous ozone and reactive oxygen species scientists worldwide dating back to the late 1700's. \u00a0With the help of many brilliant scientists and many years of painstaking trial and error, Dr. Group was able to stabilize reactive oxygen species to magnesium compounds, and Oxy-Powder\u00ae was born.

To assist the  cleansing process, it's advised to drink half of your body weight in  ounces of purified water daily while taking Oxy-Powder\u00ae even though  there has never been a documented case of dehydration or electrolyte  imbalance. To figure out your body weight in ounces, please divide your  body weight in half.

It all started by studying a combination of herbs that have been traditionally understood to enhance and regulate the body as well as the works of the most famous 16th century healer, scientist and formulator,\u00a0Paracelsus.\nParacelsus originally composed the word Spagyria (Spagyry), which means to extract (spao) and combine (ageiro). The word was used to describe the process and power of turning a preparation of herbs into a liquid formula dedicated to enhancing health. \nThis original technology was taken and advanced by using the science of modern day technology.\nThe Spagyrex process used in Infowars Life products combines ancient and current technologies to create a revolutionary, multi-step, proprietary herbal formula technique that does not chemically change the natural ingredients. This follows the principle of separating and recombining all the elements of an herb, to extract the most powerful essence of its healing nature. \nSuper Male Vitality Ingredients:\nPlease note: while these Asian and South American herbs have been available individually in specialty herb shops in the United States for decades, we have brought them together in a unique combination for you.\nTribulus terrestris (fruit)\nTribulus terrestris is a vigorous plant integrated into the Super Male Vitality.\u00a0 Numerous benefits regarding vitality are attributed to the plant by men worldwide. \nSuma (root)\nSuma is a ground vine with deep roots.

Maca was made popular by indigenous tribes in Peru who have used the root for purposes of vitality for quite some time.\nAvena sativa (root)\nAlso known as the common oat, avena sativa contains natural compounds that may help support normal response in men.\nTongkat ali (root)\nTongkat ali, or Malaysian ginseng, is traditionally held to support a number of natural functions in men.\nCatuaba (bark)\nNative to the Amazon, catuaba is a small, flowering tree.

The Top 5 Reasons You Need Nascent Iodine \n\nIodine is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health and well-being.\u00a0 \nNascent iodine may support healthy iodine levels.\u00a0 \nNascent iodine may support healthy hormone levels.\u00a0 \nNascent iodine may be involved in maintaining healthy metabolism.\nSupplementing with pure nascent iodine may provide sufficient iodine so that the body does not need to absorb iodine from other, perhaps less pure, sources.\n\nSurvival Shield X-2 QualitySurvival Shield X-2 is manufactured in a state-licensed facility that meets federal regulatory standards, is cGMP/HACCP-compliant, and lab grade. Raw elemental iodine is a controlled substance both at a State and Federal level. The licensing, approvals and regulatory documentary procedures are exacting and costly.Bound forms of iodine must first be separated, clarified and purified from other binding components or impurities into a USP-grade (United States Pharmaceutical), mono-elemental iodine as certified USP resublimated iodine crystals. In this purified crystal form, iodine is a highly reactive and toxic substance. However, when the purified USP iodine crystals are subjected to a proprietary process it becomes nano-colloidalized and transforms into a form of elemental nascent iodine, also referred to as monoatomic iodine, without the addition of iodides!Shocking Statistics About Iodine\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization's Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, iodine deficiency is a public health problem in 54 countries.\nThe CDC states that iodine deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world (Fortunately, it is the easiest to correct).\nThe 2013 USGS iodine commodity summary warns that there are no comparable substitutes for iodine.\nInformation published by UNICEF notes that iodine deficiency is the most avoidable cause of stunted physical and intellectual development.\n\nWhat Are The Health Benefits Of Nascent Iodine?\n\nProper iodine levels may provide support for normal response to environmental and dietary toxins.\nSupports thyroid health.\nMay support breast milk production and quality.\n\n Why Is Survival Shield X-2 The Best Nascent Iodine Available?\n\nSurvival Shield X-2 is created from salt solutions found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface. \nIt is tested for radiation by our quality control experts before being placed for sale. \nIt is approximately 50% stronger than our original Survival Shield formulation. \nIt is a true glycerite of natural USP grade iodine\nThe nascent iodine in Survival Shield X-2 is not subjected to direct heat, harsh chemicals, or alcohol.\nThe transformative process produces a stable product that no other brand can match!\nCompletely non-GMO certified.\nVegan-friendly and completely non-toxic.\nIt provides high elemental iodine uptake.\nContains NO inefficient iodides.\nDoes not sting or burn.\n\nIMPORTANT SHIPPING INFORMATION:\u00a0International Customers, please check with your country's customs office regarding the import of the products.\u00a0 As the buyer, you are solely responsible for any import restrictions, prohibited import items, taxes, tariffs, fees and other duties.\nSurvival Shield X-2 now ships from a separate warehouse via USPS.
