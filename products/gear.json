Stone also reveals how and why the mainstream media got it wrong, including how the polls were loaded and completely misunderstood who would vote.\nStone, a long time Trump retainer and confidant, gives us the inside story of how Donald Trump almost single-handedly harnessed discontent among \u201cForgotten Americans\u201d despite running a guerrilla-style grass roots campaign to compete with the smooth running and free-spending Clinton political machine.\nStone's analysis is akin to Theodore H. White\u2019s seminal book The Making of the President 1960. It is both a sweeping analysis of the trends that elected Trump as well as the war stories of a hard-bitten political survivor who Donald Trump called \u201cone tough cookie.\"\nAbout The Author\nHost of the Stone Cold Truth show, Roger Stone is a seasoned political operative and pundit. A veteran of nine national presidential campaigns, he served as a senior campaign aide to three Republican presidents.

Stone also reveals how and why the mainstream media got it wrong, including how the polls were loaded and completely misunderstood who would vote.\nStone, a long time Trump retainer and confidant, gives us the inside story of how Donald Trump almost single-handedly harnessed discontent among \u201cForgotten Americans\u201d despite running a guerrilla-style grass roots campaign to compete with the smooth running and free-spending Clinton political machine.\nStone's analysis is akin to Theodore H. White\u2019s seminal book The Making of the President 1960. It is both a sweeping analysis of the trends that elected Trump as well as the war stories of a hard-bitten political survivor who Donald Trump called \u201cone tough cookie.\"\nAbout The Author\nHost of the Stone Cold Truth show, Roger Stone is a seasoned political operative and pundit.
