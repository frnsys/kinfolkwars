				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introducing The Relationships Special</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The summer issue of <i>Kinfolk </i>examines an essential element of modern life: the relationship. Whether romantic or platonic, new or life-long, hot, cold or ambivalent, each has carefully formed subtleties and undercurrents to unpack.</p>
<p class="p1">In this issue, we examine the moral complexities behind telling lies, explore the reassurance inherent in non-verbal communication and meet a diverse and inspiring cross-section of lovers, siblings and families, uncovering what it really means to be in a relationship.</p>

<p>The spring issue of <i>Kinfolk</i> examines the nuances of free time, its rituals and rhythms and its capacity to reinvigorate. Rather than advising how to fill 48 hours, the issue offers insight into why we should fill our weekends, and how doing so can lead to personal fulfillment.</p>
<p>With a dynamic mix of long-form journalism, interviews and shorter essays, plus concept-driven visual stories and contributors across the globe, the forthcoming issue of <i>Kinfolk</i> continues to dedicate its editorial to exploring personal values and quality of life.</p>
<p class="p1">From the curious cultural mythologies behind sleep and fashion editorial for looking good on laundry day to interviews with Moses Sumney, Dimore Studio and more, this issue will inspire readers with a fresh outlook on going off-duty.</p>

<p>Within the pages of the 21st issue of <em>Kinfolk</em>, the home becomes more than the sum of its walls and floors, chairs and wallpaper—more than a collection of objects.</p>
<p>We delve deeply into the very nature of home, exploring what’s hidden, unseen, mysterious and sensual. And we look into what we have forgotten or overlooked in the rituals of our daily lives. In turn, the home and everything it contains are not merely ends in themselves, but the complex elements of each person’s evolving and deeply personal narrative—the foundations of a well-lived life.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introducing the Travel Issue. </strong></p>
<p class="p2"><em>Kinfolk</em> Issue Twenty: The summer edition of <em>Kinfolk </em>not only draws attention to far-flung locations but also to those who choose to stay local and see their surroundings anew. Pulling from our global community of contributors from Stockholm to Tokyo, we embarked on ventures in more than a dozen cities on four continents. Through exposure to new cultures and foreign contexts, we often return home filled with fresh perspectives that can make the everyday seem exotic. But worldly experiences don’t start and end at the baggage claim—it’s what we do with those memories once we’ve unpacked our suitcases that really makes a difference in the long run.</p>

<p>The spring edition of <em>Kinfolk</em> explores our relationship with adrenaline and its vital contribution to our quality of life. After all, finding joy in knuckle-whitening moments can be enlivening, not immobilizing.</p>
<p>Whether it’s through leaping out of a plane at 14,000 feet or cutting off all our hair, or by cliff-diving into the sea or getting a tattoo, making friends with fear opens us up to a flurry of exhilaration.</p>
<p>If we aspire to live life instead of just watch it, our days won’t be safe or stilted: The best stories start with the most unexpected moments, and these experiences normally come from confronting our comfort zones instead of taking the easy, expected or well-lit route.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Kinfolk Issue Eighteen: For our winter edition, we explore the relationship between community and design. How<br />
can design strengthen bonds with our families, friends and neighbors? And how can good design improve our<br />
quality of life? Design is a type of communication. It’s about the way an object or idea speaks to its audience. But<br />
good design not only gets its message across—it also engages us in a conversation. The voices in this issue’s pages<br />
have taught us that there’s no set of rules that govern what constitutes “good design.” Form doesn’t have to follow<br />
function, function doesn’t have to follow form—in fact, there shouldn’t be any following at all, only leading.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introducing the Family Issue</strong></p>
<p>The autumn edition of <em>Kinfolk</em> explores the relationships we have with our nearest and dearest, in all of their iterations. We ask some big questions: How is photography changing the way we construct our family narratives? Should we feel guilty about speaking to our barista more than our sister? And did our parents actually have any idea what they were doing?</p>
<p>Our concept of family is deeply personal and forever evolving. No matter what kind of family we come from or the type of family we want to create ourselves, there’s no longer a universal concept of “normal.” There’s no ubiquitous manual to consult, rules to follow or boxes to check.</p>
<p>Well, maybe just a few: love, understanding, empathy and support. And perhaps a little patience.</p>
