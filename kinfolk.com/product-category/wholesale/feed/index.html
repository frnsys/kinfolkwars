				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Within the pages of the 21nd issue of <em>Kinfolk</em>, the home becomes more than the sum of its walls and floors, chairs and wallpaper—more than a collection of objects.</p>
<p>We delve deeply into the very nature of home, exploring what’s hidden, unseen, mysterious and sensual asking, “What have we forgotten, or overlooked, in the rituals of our daily lives?” In turn, the home and everything it contains are not merely ends in themselves, but the complex elements of each person’s evolving and deeply personal narrative—the foundations of a well-lived life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="s1">Balance is the intersection between calm and action, between rest and the excitement of life. From finding equilibrium in unexpected places to creating it with considered effort, a well-honed balancing act elevates the everyday and prepares us for tomorrow. Over time we add and subtract to balance our own scales, in a way that keeps us grounded yet always on our toes. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">When nature lowers the dial on sunlight and heat, our moods can easily sink in unison. Winter is when Danish folks savor their tradition of <em>hygge</em> (pronounced “<em>hyoo-guh</em>”), which is a sense of coziness, comfort and belonging all wrapped up in one. Hygge exists in all candlelit rooms, convivial conversations and shared meals in Denmark. But everyone around the globe can enjoy the feeling of hygge—just curl up with a book, gather in the kitchen or cuddle a furry companion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">These are 48 hours to call it how you like. It’s a judgment-free zone to be as still, active, solo or social as you please. Maybe you’ll be the center of your weekend and enjoy a dinner for one, phone switched beyond silent to off. Alternatively, your two days might entail a series of catch-ups, rendezvous and soirees with good pals. No matter how you fill the hours, make sure they’re filled on your terms.</p>
