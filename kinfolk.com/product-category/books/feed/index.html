		<description><![CDATA[<p><em>The Kinfolk Home</em> welcomes readers into 35 homes around the world that reflect some of the key principles of slow living: cultivating community, simplifying our lives and reclaiming time for what matters most.</p>
<p>With 289 full-color photographs spanning 368 pages, <em>The Kinfolk Home</em> is a detailed exploration into living spaces from the United States, Scandinavia, Asia and more.</p>
<p>Through a mix of portrait and interior photography, profiles and essays, we visit the homes of designers, entrepreneurs, architects, photographers and stylists. Delving deeper than decor, author Nathan Williams invites each resident to share their values, the ways those ideals have shaped their homes and the ways their homes have in turn shaped them.  At the heart of each living space is an aesthetic shaped by the dweller’s idea of what is essential—whether it’s a collection of inherited French antiques, a table long enough for a dinner party of a dozen, a smattering of children’s sketches pasted on the walls or minimalist rooms reserved for creative thought. What each of these homes shares in common is that they’ve been put together carefully, slowly, and with intention.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><em>The Kinfolk Table</em> puts the emphasis back on the relationships that surround eating. One-third cookbook, one-third narrative tale and one-third international adventure, <em>The Kinfolk Table</em> is a collection of 85 delectable recipes spread over 368 pages from creative types around the world including Brooklyn, Copenhagen, Canada and the English countryside.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Filled with gorgeous photography and design you’re used to seeing in the magazine, the book will inspire your next small gathering. We traveled around the world, sharing food and collecting ideas from our growing community of chefs, home cooks, designers, bloggers, photographers and others, many of whom contributed recipes to <em>The Kinfolk Table</em>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of the suggestions are refreshingly simple, like throwing freshly harvested mussels on the grill or filling half a cantaloupe with yogurt and honey. Others may take a little more time and patience, such as Ginger Ice Cream with Kumquat Compote or perfecting a shoulder of veal. Danish, Japanese, Mexican and Korean influences make appearances too, as do fresh takes on classics such as Sweet Potato-Quinoa Burgers, Kimchi Couscous or Spiced Raw Chocolate Mousse.</span></p>
